Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a form of AM, which builds objects layer-by-layer deposition of feedstock material using a 3D printer machine and computer software.  Fused filament fabrication (FFF, also known as Filament Freeform Fabrication) is one 3D printing process in which filaments are melted and extruded from a heated nozzle to deposit material.  FFF is an emerging technology and one of the most popular additive manufacturing processes, especially for consumers and small manufacturers.  Polycarbonate (PC) is a versatile material and PC filaments are widely used for fused filament fabrication 3D printing.  PC filaments are often loaded with additives to achieve different properties of the print objects.  These additives range from dyes, organometallic compounds, carbon nanomaterials, nanometal oxides to micrometer-scale particles such as copper, bronze, steel, tungsten, gold, and aluminum nitride (Vance et al., 2017).   Several engineered nanomaterials were infused into PC filaments, such as silicon dioxide nanoparticles, titanium nitride nanoparticles (Vidakis et al., 2021), titanium carbide nanopowder (Vidakis et al., 2022a), aluminum nitride nanoparticles (Vidakis et al., 2022b), and carbon nanotubes (Potter et al., 2021).\n\nDuring heating, PC filament undergoes thermal degradation and releases fine particles (0.1 to 2.5 um) and incidental nanoparticles (d < 100 nm) as well as numerous volatile, and semi-volatile organic compounds that are likely derived from PC polymer and additives in the polymer (Azimi et al., 2016; Byrley et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2019; Stefaniak et al., 2017; Stefaniak et al., 2019; Alijagic et al., 2022; Tedla et al., 2022).   These emissions could pose a potential hazard to human health.  Currently, the potential health hazard of PC filament printing emissions has not been determined.\n\nA NIOSH research group used a condensation nuclei counter to study PC filament emission rates, and determined that the number-based particle emission rates from an industrial-scale material extrusion AM machine were around 2.2 x1011 number/minute and the total volatile organic compound emission rates were around 1.9 x 104 µg/minute (Stefaniak et al., 2019).  The same group also found low levels of acetone, benzene, toluene, and m,p-xylene during PC filament printing processes.  Potter et al showed that PC filament emissions contained bisphenol A (BPA), phenol, chlorobenzene, DEHP, and di-tert-butylphenol (Potter et al., 2019).  In our previous studies on PC filament printer emission-induced cell toxicity (Farcas et al., 2019), emissions from a commercial PC 3D printer were generated in a chamber using a 3D printer and collected in cell culture medium.  The number-based size distribution of the particles inside the chamber was between 140-170 nm and the mean particle sizes in cell culture medium were 201±18 nm.  Analysis of elemental composition of particles collected in the cell culture medium found C, O, Ca, Na, Si, Ni, Cr, Fe, S, Al, and Cl.  The organic compounds in the emission collection cell culture medium were BPA, p-isopropenylphenol, and phenol.  At 24 h post-exposure, PC emissions were internalized in human small airway epithelial cells (SAEC) and induced a dose-dependent cytotoxicity, oxidative stress, apoptosis, necrosis, and increases in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production in SAEC (Farcas et al., 2019).  The results demonstrated that PC filament 3D printing emissions induce a cellular toxicity in SAEC.\n\nAlthough cell-based in vitro toxicity analysis is increasingly applied to screen and rank chemicals for prioritizing toxicity studies, as well as to study toxic mechanisms, the toxicological significance of in vitro study-generated data in hazard and risk assessment is limited.

FFRs are primarily reserved for those personnel who have a greater risk and longer duration of exposure compared with other workers and the general public. Some FFR models contain an exhalation valve, which is a device that closes to allow inhaled breath to be pulled through the filter media and opens to allow exhaled breath to be expelled from the respirator through the exhalation valve as well as the filter media. These FFR models provide the wearer with a level of protection like that of an FFR without an exhalation valve, and they are thought to increase the wearer’s comfort at high work rates and be suitable for longer periods of use. However, respiratory secretions expelled by wearers may exit along with air through the exhalation valve. A concern with FFRs with an exhalation valve is that individuals may spread disease if unfiltered, virus-laden aerosols pass through the valve.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) did not recommend using an FFR with an exhalation valve for source control (i.e., to filter respiratory secretions to prevent disease transmission to others) and advised that if only this option isavailable and source control was needed, then the valve should be covered with a surgical mask, procedure mask, or a cloth face covering that does not interfere with the respirator fit. The CDC requested research to provide improved science-based recommendations on the use of exhalation valves.\n\nThis study had three aims: (1) to measure the filtration efficiency provided by FFRs with an exhalation valve under conditions of inward airflow (i.e., in the direction of inhalation) and outward airflow (i.e., in the direction of exhalation); (2) to evaluate how particle penetration in FFRs with an exhalation valve compares to particle penetration in surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings, and fabric from cotton t-shirts; and (3) to determine the filtration efficiency of three modifications to the exhalation valve in FFRs with the goal of mitigating the emission of unfiltered particles. To accomplish these three aims, thirteen FFR models were each tested in two positions: inward position, which is used by the NIOSH Respirator Approval Program when testing N-type respirators, and outward position, which was used experimentally to channel airflow in the direction of exhalation. For the inward position, three mitigation strategies were used:\n(1)covering the valve on the interior of the FFR with commonly available surgical tape,\n(2)covering the valve on the interior of the FFR with an electrocardiogram (ECG) pad; and\n(3)stretching a surgical mask over the exterior of the FFR.\n\nThe purpose of these three strategies was to measure the varying filtration efficiencies to determine their contribution toward source control. Both positions and all mitigation strategies were tested at three airflow rates: 25, 55, and 85 lpm (liters per minute). In addition to the FFR evaluations, researchers evaluated a selection of surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings, and fabric from cotton t-shirts using the outward position and flowrates described previously.","title":"NPPTL Filtering Facepiece Respirators with an Exhalation Valve: Measurements of Filtration Efficiency to Evaluate Their Potential for Source Control","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/24ct-nyt8/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/art/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-12-18","keyword":["clinic","art","success rates","assisted reproductive technology","services","infertility","fertility"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"ARTINFO","hasEmail":"mailto:ARTINFO@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/24w5-nppr","description":"Data were updated on September 11, 2024.\n\nART data are made available as part of the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) that collects success rates, services, profiles and annual summary data from fertility clinics across the U.S. There are four datasets available: ART Services and Profiles, ART Patient and Cycle Characteristics, ART Success Rates, and ART Summary.

Little is known about the presence of nano-crystalline silica (NCS), i.e., particles below 100 nm. We present a methodology to quantify the crystalline silica content in the sub-100 nm size fraction of the aerosol released during engineered stone fabrication using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Fourier transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. Aerosol was generated in test chamber designed per EN 1093-3 and sampled using cascade impactors. XRD and FT-IR analysis showed the presence of both α-quartz (15 – 60 %) and cristobalite (10 – 50 %) polymorphs in all size fractions. With increasing particle size, the cristobalite content increased. 70 % of the total aerosol mass in the sub-100 nm fraction was found to be crystalline silica, qualitatively confirmed by electron diffraction and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Presence of other minerals was detected in all size fractions; no polymeric resin binder was detected in the sub-100 nm fraction. Although, the sub-100 nm fraction was about 1 % of the aerosol mass, it accounted for 4 – 24 % of the aerosol surface area based on total lung deposition. If the surface area is a more relevant exposure metric, the assessment of efficacy of current engineering control systems using mass as an exposure metric may not provide adequate protection.","title":"Release of Crystalline Silica Nanoparticles During Engineered Stone Fabrication","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/2juy-3evq/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:20"],"landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/2kh7-g39q","issued":"2024-11-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-11-20","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Physical Effects Research Branch (PERB), Health Effects Laboratory Division (HELD)","hasEmail":"mailto:sa-cin-webteam@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/2kh7-g39q","description":"Three-dimensional (3D) printing is increasingly being used in manufacturing settings, homes and schools.  Fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printers are the most widely used systems with standard thermoplastics such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid and polycarbonate (PC) commonly used in the manufacturing processes.  Heating of the thermoplastic generates and releases particulates and fumes.  Emission constituents frequently measured include aldehydes, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes.  Inhalation of the emitted particulates and/or the fumes, that contain bisphenol A (BPA)  may pose health problems to users of these systems as well as bystanders.\n\nThe goal of the current study was to examine the effects of inhalation of PC-emissions generated during 3D-printing.  PC-emissions can include bisphenol A (BPA). Bisphenols are known endocrine and metabolic disruptors (i.e., they interfere with actions of steroid and thyroid hormones) and have been shown to have significant effects on a number of physiological systems including the endocrine and cardiovascular systems.  Because steroid hormones have major effects on cardiovascular function, it is possible that inhalation of PC particulate and/or BPA impact cardiovascular function.\n\nTo begin to understand how inhalation of PC-emissions generated during 3D printing might affect the cardiovascular system, the current study examined the effects of inhaling PC-emissions after 1, 4, 8, 15 and 30d of exposure, on peripheral vascular responses to vaso-modulating agents, on cardiac morphology and on the expression of proteins and transcripts that are markers of inflammation, oxidative stress and cardiovascular dysfunction.","title":"Exposure to emissions generated by 3-dimensional printing with polycarbonate affects vascular morphology and expression of markers of oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in cardiac tissue","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/2kh7-g39q/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/2khz-k7sv","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-23","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-02","keyword":["nedss","netss","nndss","wonder","rubella congenital syndrome","rubella","2019"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/2khz-k7sv","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1DD.

Little is known about the health effects associated with these aerosols. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to aerosols (25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 4 d) generated during thermal spray coating using different consumables [i.e., stainless-steel wire (PMET731), Ni-based wire (PMET885), Zn-based wire (PMET540)]. Control animals received air. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed at 4 and 30 d post-exposure to assess lung toxicity. The particles were chain-like agglomerates and similar in size (310–378 nm). Inhalation of PMET885 aerosol caused a significant increase in lung injury and inflammation at both time points. Inhalation of PMET540 aerosol caused a slight but significant increase in lung toxicity at 4 but not 30 d. Exposure to PMET731 aerosol had no effect on lung toxicity. Overall, the lung responses were in the order: PMET885>>PMET540>PMT731. Following a shorter exposure (25 mg/m3 x 4 h/d x 1d), lung burdens of metals from the different aerosols were determined by ICP-AES at 0, 1, 4 and 30 d post-exposure. Zn was cleared from the lungs at the fastest rate with complete clearance by 4 d post-exposure. Ni, Cr, and Mn had similar rates of clearance as nearly half of the deposited metal was cleared by 4 d. A small but significant percentage of each of these metals persisted in the lungs at 30 d. The pulmonary clearance of Fe was difficult to assess because of inherently high levels of Fe in control lungs.","title":"Lung toxicity, deposition, and clearance of thermal spray coating particles with different metal profiles after inhalation in rats","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/2se8-zi9r/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/statesystem/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-07-19","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-04-01","keyword":["state system","tobacco","smokefree indoor air","policy","osh","legislation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/2snk-eav4","description":"1995-2025.

Currently, there are two major test standards that are widely applied in helmet industry: ANSI/ISEA Z89.1 and EN397.  Since drop impacts are performed using different impactors and at drop heights, results obtained using different test standards are not directly comparable. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate and compare the helmet impact test results obtained using these two frequently used helmet test standards. A representative basic Type I construction helmet model was selected for the study. A total of 19 drop impact tests were performed at different drop heights and with two different impactors (3.6 kg and 5.0 kg). Group (a) contains 10 drop impacts performed using the 3.6 kg  impactor at drop heights from 0.31 m to 1.93 m. Group (b) contains 9 drop impacts performed using the 5.0 kg impactor at drop heights from 0.22 m to 1.32 m. Each of the impact trials was replicated four times. Relationships between the peak impact force and the drop height for these two test groups were analyzed and compared. When the helmets were tested with potential impact energy smaller than critical values, a consistent trend for the relationship of peak impact force as a function of the potential impact energy was obtained. Our results show that our previously proposed quantitative evaluation approach for industrial helmets’ shock absorption performance can be used with either the ANSI/ISEA Z89.1 or EN395 standard to quantify industrial helmets’ shock absorption performance. Furthermore, our results illustrated that the peak impact force would not be a reliable parameter to evaluate the helmets’ safety margin.","title":"Testing the shock protection performance of Type I construction helmets using impactors of different masses","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/338g-fx72/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/33kn-dpz2","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2018-01-04","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2018-01-04","keyword":["2017","legionellosis","malaria","mmwr","nedss","netss","nndss","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/33kn-dpz2","description":"NNDSS - Table II.

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch.

These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–019 or 2014–2018 estimates.

The purpose of this study was to identify and validate conceptual domains around food safety culture and develop an assessment tool that can be used to assess food workers’ perceptions of their restaurant’s food safety culture. The study, conducted from March 2018 through March 2019, surveyed restaurant food workers for their level of agreement with 28 statements. We received 579 responses from 331 restaurants spread across eight different health department jurisdictions. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling supported a model composed of four primary constructs. The highest rated construct was Resource Availability (\n=4.69, sd=0.57), which assessed the availability of resources to maintain good hand hygiene. The second highest rated construct was Employee Commitment (=4.49, sd=0.62), which assessed workers’ perceptions of their coworkers’ commitment to food safety. The last two constructs were related to management. Leadership (=4.28, sd=0.69) assessed the existence of food safety policies, training, and information sharing. Management Commitment (=3.94, sd=1.05) assessed whether food safety was a priority in practice.

The data contain weekly, aggregate counts of RSV tests performed and RSV detections as reported to NREVSS since April 11, 2020. \n\nNREVSS data are reported weekly at the national and 10 HHS regional levels (https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html). The presented data are RSV Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) results, which include reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests. These data exclude antigen, antibody, and at-home test results. Less than 5% of RSV tests reported to NREVSS are from antigen tests. All data are provisional and subject to change. Reporting is less complete for the most recent weeks, but relatively complete (>90%) for the period up to 2 weeks earlier. \n\nPercent positivity is a surveillance metric used to monitor RSV activity over time and by geographic area. Participating laboratories send weekly reports of the total number of RSV tests performed that week, and the number of those tests that were positive. In the table and upon hovering on the map, the total test counts reflect the latest data reported to NREVSS and may differ from data presented by public health jurisdictions. Public health jurisdictions may have additional data not reported to NREVSS and may use a different reporting cadence. The RSV trend graphs display the weekly average percent of tests positive for RSV among all the tests performed. Each point on the regional table displays the average number of RSV tests that were performed, and the average percent of those that were positive during a 3-week period (i.e., the specified week, and the weeks immediately preceding and following it). This is also known as a centered, 3-week moving average. The RSV detections displayed are the 5-week moving average (average of the 4 previous and current weeks) in accordance with the recommendations for assessing RSV trends by detections (https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/216/3/345/3860464). \n\nNREVSS strives to present precise estimates of respiratory viral trends and minimize reporting burden for participating laboratories. However, there are several limitations to this surveillance system. NREVSS is a laboratory-based surveillance system that does not have patient-specific data; multiple tests from a single patient may be included. In addition, NREVSS does not collect demographic or clinical data (i.e., hospitalizations or deaths). Testing practices may vary regionally, and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Laboratories from all 50 states report data weekly, but reporting is voluntary and may not be representative of local RSV activity. The data do not include all test results within a jurisdiction and therefore do not reflect all RSV NAATs administered regionally or nationally. Participating laboratories vary in size, testing capabilities, and areas and populations served. Geographic results from clinical laboratories are based on testing location and laboratories may test samples from across one or more states.

Eight participants (5 males and 3 females) performed 4 different patient handling tasks, including 1) lying to sitting, 2) sitting to standing, 3) standing to sitting, and 4) bed to wheelchair transfer with and without the exoskeleton. In certain bed-to-chair patient handling tasks, the exoskeleton (Laevo V2.5) was found to significantly reduce the peak and median values of the hip flexion angles and muscle activities of erector spinae compared to no exoskeleton. The effect of the exoskeleton was task-dependent. The exoskeleton caused a greater reduction of the erector spinae muscle activities of symmetric exertions than the asymmetric exertions. With the exoskeleton, participants adjusted their patient handling strategies by decreasing the hip flexion but increasing the trunk extension. There was a lack of significant changes in the heart rate with the exoskeleton.  The results suggest that back-support exoskeletons could play a role in reducing the muscular demand of the low back during certain bed-to-chair patient handling tasks.

Recruitment of immune cells to the lung microenvironment via secreted chemokines by alveolar macrophages may plays important roles during asthma pathogenesis. Our prior studies identified MDI/MDI-GSH-exposure downregulates endogenous human/murine(hsa/mmu)-microRNA(miR)-206-3p, resulting in the activation of mmu/hsa-miR-206-3p-regulated signaling including KLF4-mediated signaling in MØs. The hsa-miR-206-3p-regulated signaling activation leading to induction of chemokines and chemotaxis activities of immune cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI/ MDI in the form of MDI-GSH conjugate exposure downregulated endogenous hsa-miR-206-3p expression is unclear. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in many different biological processes by targeting endogenous miRs, affecting protein translation and gene transcription in different cell types. The circRNA expression can be regulated via outside stimuli exposures; however, whether MDI-exposure influence circRNAs expression is unknown. Several circRNAs have been identified to regulate hsa-miR-206-3p levels through miR binding/targeting. We hypothesize that MDI-exposure induces endogenous circRNA(s) to regulate hsa-miR-206-3p in MØs. The first aim of this study was to identified candidate hsa-miR-206-3p-binding circRNA(s) that can be regulated by MDI/MDI-GSH regulated. The second aim of this study was to examine whether MDI/MDI-GSH regulated hsa-miR-206-3p-binding circRNA(s) can indeed regulate the endogenous hsa-miR-206-3p in MØs. After identified the roles of endogenous circRNA(s) in regulation of endogenous hsa-miR-206-3p after MDI/MDI-GSH-exposure, we investigated the roles of circRNAs in regulation of hsa-miR-206-3p-mediated M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines’ expressions in relation to the exposure to MDI.","title":"Circular RNA hsa_circ_0008726 Targets the hsa-miR-206-3p/KLF4 Axis to Modulate 4,4’-Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate-Glutathione Conjugate-Induced Chemokine Transcription in Macrophages","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/3h4m-i8xf/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"rights":"public","issued":"2018-02-07","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"2003/2020","modified":"2025-04-21","references":["http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/dvs_data_release.htm","https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm","https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/bridged_race.htm","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/rssa.12266/abstract","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877584516300442","https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr66/nvsr66_01.pdf","http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvss/bridged_race/County_Geography_Changes.pdf"],"keyword":["u.s. teen birth rate","united states","teen births","nchs","county trends on teen births","county teen birth trends"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:births@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3h58-x6cd","description":"This data set contains estimated teen birth rates for age group 15–19 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15–19) by county and year.\n\nDEFINITIONS\n\nEstimated teen birth rate: Model-based estimates of teen birth rates for age group 15–19 (expressed per 1,000 females aged 15–19) for a specific county and year. Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates “borrow strength” across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information—including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables—to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.\nMedian teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15–19 for counties in a state.\nBayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.\n\nNOTES\n\nData on the number of live births for women aged 15–19 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003–2015 (5).\n\nPopulation estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.\n\nHierarchical Bayesian space–time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003–2015 (1,2,3,4).\n\nThe Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-α)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector θ and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space Ф such that\n1-α≤P({C│y})=∫p{θ │y}dθ,\nwhere integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of θ.  The probability that θ lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- α) (6).\n\nCounty borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003–2015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003–2015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005–2007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).","title":"NCHS - Teen Birth Rates for Age Group 15-19 in the United States by County","isPartOf":"NCHS - Teen Birth Rates for Age Group 15-19 in the United States by County","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3h58-x6cd/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3h58-x6cd/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3h58-x6cd/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3h58-x6cd/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3h58-x6cd/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3h58-x6cd/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3h58-x6cd/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"50 states and District of Columbia","describedBy":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"],"language":["English"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/prams/index.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-07-19","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-09-06","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/prams/index.htm","https://www.cdc.gov/prams/pramstat/index.html"],"keyword":["obesity","preconception health","pregnancy history","abuse","prenatal care","reproductive health","sleep behavior","smoke exposure","stress","tobacco use","unintended pregnancy","wic","breastfeeding","alcohol use","contraception","infant health","medicaid","mental health","morbidity"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DRH Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:PRAMSProposals@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3hwj-hqmh","description":"2000.

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThis archived public use dataset has 11 data elements reflecting United States COVID-19 community levels for all available counties. \n\nThe COVID-19 community levels were developed using a combination of three metrics — new COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population in the past 7 days, the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients, and total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. The COVID-19 community level was determined by the higher of the new admissions and inpatient beds metrics, based on the current level of new cases per 100,000 population in the past 7 days. New COVID-19 admissions and the percent of staffed inpatient beds occupied represent the current potential for strain on the health system. Data on new cases acts as an early warning indicator of potential increases in health system strain in the event of a COVID-19 surge.\n\nUsing these data, the COVID-19 community level was classified as low, medium, or high.\n\nCOVID-19 Community Levels were used to help communities and individuals make decisions based on their local context and their unique needs. Community vaccination coverage and other local information, like early alerts from surveillance, such as through wastewater or the number of emergency department visits for COVID-19, when available, can also inform decision making for health officials and individuals.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date data for any county or state, visit the relevant health department website. COVID Data Tracker may display data that differ from state and local websites. This can be due to differences in how data were collected, how metrics were calculated, or the timing of web updates.\n\n<b>Archived Data Notes:</b>\n\nThis dataset was renamed from \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County as Originally Posted\" to \"United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County\" on March 31, 2022. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Column name for county population was changed to “county_population”. No change was made to the data points previous released.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> New column, “health_service_area_population”, was added to the dataset to denote the total population in the designated Health Service Area based on 2019 Census estimate. \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> FIPS codes for territories American Samoa, Guam, Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and United States Virgin Islands were re-formatted to 5-digit numeric for records released on 3/3/2022 to be consistent with other records in the dataset.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Changes were made to the text fields in variables “county”, “state”, and “health_service_area” so the formats are consistent across releases.\n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> The “%” sign was removed from the text field in column “covid_inpatient_bed_utilization”. No change was made to the data. As indicated in the column description, values in this column represent the percentage of staffed inpatient beds occupied by COVID-19 patients (7-day average).  \n\n<b>March 31, 2022:</b> Data values for columns, “county_population”, “health_service_area_number”, and “health_service_area” were backfilled for records released on 2/24/2022.

These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type. \n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all “Patients using their own eggs” or for “Patients with no prior ART using their own eggs.” For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent’s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\n\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\n\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

This assessment is designed to describe how the environment contributed to the outbreak and identifies factors that contributed to the outbreak and environmental antecedents to the outbreak. Environmental antecedents, also referred to as root causes, are specific reasons that allow biological or chemical agents to contaminate, survive, or grow in food. From 2017 – 2019, 24 jurisdictions reported 1,430 antecedents from 393 outbreaks to the National Environmental Assessments Reporting System. The most reported antecedents were lack of oversight of employees/enforcement of policies (89.1%), lack of training of employees on specific processes (74.0%), and lack of a food safety culture/attitude towards food safety (57.5%). These findings highlight the critical role that employees play in restaurant food safety and are heavily influenced by restaurant management, who can exercise active managerial control to manage these antecedents.

Pathophysiological mechanism(s) by which how MDI causes OA is still warranted to be elucidated. Alveolar macrophages are the most abundant immune cell type in the lung, and these cells serve as one of the first immune responders against inhaled pathogens, particles, stimuli, and chemical allergens such as dNCOs. Upon encountering outside stimuli, alveolar macrophages react by phagocytosis as well as producing and secreting different mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and others, into the alveoli microenvironment to orchestrate the initiation of inflammatory/immune responses. Dysfunction of alveolar macrophages, including elevated production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other immune mediators, has been shown to play an important role in asthma pathogenesis. In the clinical setting, the levels of many immune mediators produced by macrophages have been found elevated in the asthmatic airway. However, both the levels of these asthma-associated, macrophage-secreted inflammatory/immune mediators in MDI-OA patients’ airways and how expression of these mediators change in response to MDI exposure in alveolar macrophages are largely undetermined. Previously, we demonstrated a microRNA (miR)-206-3p and miR-381-3p mediated PPP3CA/Calcineurin signaling induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transcription in macrophages and bronchoalveolar lavage cells (BALCs) after acute MDI exposure; however, whether this mechanism participates in regulation of other asthma-associated mediators secreted by macrophages/BALCs after MDI exposure is currently unknown. The first aim of this study was to identify candidate asthma-associated, macrophage-secreted mediators that can be regulated after MDI exposure. After identified the candidate mediators can be regulated by MDI-exposure, we investigated the roles of miR-mediated calcineurin signaling in regulation of these candidate mediators’ expressions in relation to the exposure to MDI.","title":"MicroRNA-Mediated Calcineurin Signaling Activation Induces CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, IL8 and Chemotactic Activities in 4,4’-Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate Exposed Macrophages","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/4m2e-y29d/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-03-07","temporal":"1975/2020","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-09-02","references":["NCHS/Datasets/NHAMCS/"],"keyword":["hospital","hospital admissions","hospital size","health us","american hospital association","hospital ownership","outpatient surgery","outpatient visits","sdoh-access-to-health-care","community hospitals","federal hospitals","length of hospital stay","healthcare access and utilization","sdoh-use-of-health-care","health care use"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:healthus@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4q35-rqzk","description":"Data on hospital admission, average length of stay, outpatient visits, and outpatient surgery in the United States, by type of ownership and size of hospital.

The primary barriers for invading respiratory pathogens are the airway epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and antimicrobial peptides produced by these cells. The antimicrobial peptide, β-defensin-1, has antiviral activity against both enveloped and non-enveloped viruses. Significant downregulation of β-defensin1 gene (DEFB1) expression was observed when human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpCs) were exposed to IAV. HBEpCs overexpressing DEFB1 caused a significant reduction in IAV, that was confirmed by IAV matrix gene analysis and confocal microscopy. DEFB1expression after transfection with hsa-miR-186-5p and hsa-miR-340-5p provided evidence that DEFB1 expression could be modulated by these two miRNAs and hsa-miR-186-5p had a higher binding efficiency with DEFB1. Overexpression of DEFB1 in IAV infected HBEpCs led to increased NF-kB expression.  In a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) array analysis of 84 transcription factors, either overexpressing DEFB1 or siRNA silencing of DEFB1 expression significantly modulated the expression of STAT3.  In addition, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) integrated with PCR array data showed that the JAK1/STAT3 pathway was significantly altered by cells overexpressing DEFB1, suggesting that this may be one of the pathways by which defensin regulates IAV replication in HBEpCs. In conclusion, the reduction in IAV copy number in DEFB1 overexpressing cells suggests that β-defensin-1 plays a key role in regulating IAV survival through STAT3 and is a potential target for antiviral drug development.","title":"β-defensin-1 regulates influenza virus infection in human bronchial epithelial cells through the STAT3 signaling pathway","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/4rd8-s7gn/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/4t6w-ibvk","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2019-05-30","keyword":["foodborne","netss","nedss","infant","botulism","2019","wonder","other (wound and unspecified)","nndss"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4t6w-ibvk","description":"NNDSS - Table 1E.

While TBIs can range in severity, the majority of injuries are considered to be mild. However, TBI of any severity has the potential to have long-lasting neurological effects including headaches, cognitive/memory impairments, mood dysfunction, and fatigue as a result of neuronal damage and neuroinflammation. The goal of the study was to evaluate the neuroinflammatory and neuronal damage outcomes associated with mild or moderate-severe TBI via the modification of an established closed-head injury model of TBI by varying the material of the projectile.  Rats that received TBI using a stainless steel projectile exhibited outcomes strongly correlated to moderate-severe TBI, such as prolonged unconsciousness, impaired neurobehavior, increased risk for hematoma and death, as well as significant neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation throughout the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum.  In contrast, rats that received TBI with an aluminum projectile exhibited characteristics more congruous with mild TBI, such as a trend for longer periods of unconscious in the absence of neurobehavioral deficits, a lack of neurodegeneration and mild neuroinflammation.  Our results indicate that different levels of behavioral, neuroinflammatory, and damage outcomes are associated with differing levels of TBI severity.","title":"A Projectile Concussive Impact Model Produces Neuroinflammation in Both Mild and Moderate-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/4wzk-pwz3/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"non-public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/STATESystem","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-01-31","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-01-31","keyword":["gtss","adult","gats","tobacco","osh"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/4xf6-nrwk","description":"2008-2017.

All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Summary dataset provides a full snapshot of clinic services and profile, patient characteristics, and ART success rates. It is worth noting that patient medical characteristics, such as age, diagnosis, and ovarian reserve, affect ART treatment’s success. Comparison of success rates across clinics may not be meaningful because of differences in patient populations and ART treatment methods. The success rates displayed in this dataset do not reflect any one patient’s chance of success.

The dataset contains a weekly summary of the total RSV tests and RSV detections reported to NREVSS. These data are reported on a voluntary basis. Clinical laboratories do not report demographic data through NREVSS. Testing practices and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Results can be changed two years after the initial reporting week. However, discrepancies may be noted and updated at the discretion of the data stewards and key stakeholders.\n\nData are collected from collaborating university and community hospital laboratories, select states and county public health laboratories, and commercial laboratories. This information is submitted and updated on a weekly basis. \n\nWhile NREVSS strives to present the most precise national, regional and state respiratory viral trends with the least amount of burden possible for participating laboratories, there are a number of inherent limitations to this surveillance system. \n\nNREVSS does not collect patient-data or demographic information. Multiple samples may be collected from a single patient, so NREVSS results do not necessarily reflect the number of patients tested nor does it reflect hospitalizations or deaths related to a particular virus. \n\nParticipating laboratories vary in size, testing capabilities, and areas served. Some institutions may receive and test samples from sites across a given state or even from multiple states. Without direct knowledge of the population base, NREVSS cannot be used to determine the prevalence or incidence of infection.\n\n\nFor more information on RSV surveillance and research please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss and https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/us-surveillance.html","title":"Respiratory Syncytial Virus Laboratory Data (NREVSS)","programCode":["009:026"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/52kb-ccu2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/52kb-ccu2/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/52kb-ccu2/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/52kb-ccu2/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/52kb-ccu2/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/52kb-ccu2/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/52kb-ccu2/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"All US Jurisdictions","describedBy":"https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"R/P1Y","theme":["Laboratory Surveillance"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/52kh-2h7i","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2020-01-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-01-07","keyword":["nonparalytic","nedss","wonder","psittacosis","poliovirus infection","2020","nndss","netss"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/52kh-2h7i","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1AA.

These data will no longer be updated after May 2023.\n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with at least a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected. A person vaccinated with a primary series and a monovalent booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably receiving a primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine and at least one additional dose of any monovalent FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. (Note: this definition does not distinguish between vaccine recipients who are immunocompromised and are receiving an additional dose versus those who are not immunocompromised and receiving a booster dose.) A person vaccinated with a primary series and an updated (bivalent) booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected in a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably receiving a primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved vaccine and an additional dose of any bivalent FDA-authorized or approved vaccine COVID-19 vaccine on or after September 1, 2022. (Note: Doses with bivalent doses reported as first or second doses are classified as vaccinated with a bivalent booster dose.) People with primary series or a monovalent booster dose were combined in the “vaccinated without an updated booster” category. \n\nDeaths: A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Per the interim guidance of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), this should include persons whose death certificate lists COVID-19 disease or SARS-CoV-2 as the underlying cause of death or as a significant condition contributing to death. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are primarily reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19. In select jurisdictions, deaths are included that are not laboratory confirmed and are reported based on alternative dates (i.e., onset date for most; or date of death or report date, where onset date is unavailable). Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\n\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 24 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, District of Columbia, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (NY), North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and West Virginia; 23 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

Mice were sacrificed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), macrophage function, and histopathological analysis were performed at various timepoints post-exposure to evaluate resolution. Characterization of the fume indicated that most of the particles were between 0.1 and 1 µm in diameter, with a mass median aerodynamic diameter of 0.43 µm. Metal content of the fume was primarily Cu (~76%) and Ni (~12%). After exposure, BAL macrophages had a reduced ability to phagocytose E. coli at 1 and 7 days and lung cytotoxicity was evident and significant (>12-19% fold change). Loss of body weight was also significant at these two early timepoints. Lung inflammation, the predominant lesion identified by histopathology, was observed as a subacute response early that progressively resolved by 28 days with only macrophage aggregates remaining late (84 days). Future studies are planned to investigate the tumorigenic potential of Cu-Ni fume in A/J mice.","title":"Lung Toxicity Profile of Inhaled Copper-Nickel Welding Fume in A/J Mice","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/5b7j-usbu/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:20"],"landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/5bep-4fv6","issued":"2024-11-14","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-11-20","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Health Effects Laboratory Research, Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch","hasEmail":"mailto:sa-cin-webteam@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/5bep-4fv6","description":"Healthcare workers concurrently may be at a higher risk of developing respiratory infections and allergic disease, such as asthma, than the general public. Increased incidence of allergic diseases is thought to be caused, in part, due to occupational exposure to chemicals that induce or augment Th2 immune responses. However, whether exposure to these chemical antimicrobials can influence immune responses to respiratory pathogens is unknown. Here, we use a BALB/c murine model to test if the Th2-promoting antimicrobial chemical triclosan influences immune responses to influenza A virus. Mice were dermally exposed to 2% triclosan for 7 days prior to infection with a sub-lethal dose of mouse adapted PR8 A(H1N1) virus (50 pfu); triclosan exposure continued until 10 days post infection (dpi). Infected mice exposed to triclosan did not show an increase in morbidity or mortality, and viral titers were unchanged. Assessment of T cell responses at 10 dpi showed a decrease in the number of total and activated (CD44hi) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells at the site of infection (BAL and lung) in triclosan exposed mice compared to controls. Influenza-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were assessed using MHCI and MHCII tetramers, with reduced populations, although not reaching statistical significance at these sites following triclosan exposure. Reductions in the Th1 transcription factor T-bet were seen in both activated and tetramer+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the lungs of triclosan exposed infected mice, indicating reduced Th1 polarization and providing a potential mechanism for numerical reduction in T cells. Overall, these results indicate that the immune environment induced by triclosan exposure has the potential to influence the developing immune response to a respiratory viral infection and may have implications for healthcare workers who may be at an increased risk for developing infectious diseases.","title":"Effects of antimicrobial chemical exposures on influenza vaccination and antiviral immunity","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/5bep-4fv6/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:20"],"landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/5biu-jjj3","issued":"2023-07-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-09-05","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Vsafe@cdc.gov","hasEmail":"mailto:Vsafe@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/5biu-jjj3","description":"Users of the V-safe data are required to adhere to the following standards for the analysis and reporting of research data.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues.

For updated data, please refer to the <a href=\"https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html\"><b>ILINet State Activity Indicator Map</b></a>.\n\nInformation on outpatient visits to health care providers for respiratory illness referred to as influenza-like illness (ILI) is collected through the U.S. Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet). ILINet consists of outpatient healthcare providers in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. More than 100 million patient visits were reported during the 2022-23 season. Each week, more than 3,000 outpatient health care providers around the country report to CDC the number of patient visits for ILI by age group (0-4 years, 5-24 years, 25-49 years, 50-64 years, and ≥65 years) and the total number of visits for any reason. A subset of providers also reports total visits by age group. For this system, ILI is defined as fever (temperature of 100°F [37.8°C] or greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat. Activity levels are based on the percent of outpatient visits due to ILI in a jurisdiction compared to the average percent of ILI visits that occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation (non-influenza weeks) in that jurisdiction. The number of sites reporting each week is variable; therefore, baselines are adjusted each week based on which sites within each jurisdiction provide data. To perform this adjustment, provider level baseline ILI ratios are calculated for those that have a sufficient reporting history. Providers that do not have the required reporting history to calculate a provider-specific baseline are assigned the baseline ratio for their practice type. The jurisdiction level baseline is then calculated using a weighted sum of the baseline ratios for each contributing provider. \n\nThe activity levels compare the mean reported percent of visits due to ILI during the current week to the mean reported percent of visits due to ILI during non-influenza weeks. The 13 activity levels correspond to the number of standard deviations below, at, or above the mean for the current week compared with the mean during non-influenza weeks. Activity levels are classified as minimal (levels 1-3), low (levels 4-5), moderate (levels 6-7), high (levels 8-10), and very high (levels 11-13). An activity level of 1 corresponds to an ILI percentage below the mean, level 2 corresponds to an ILI percentage less than 1 standard deviation above the mean, level 3 corresponds to an ILI percentage more than 1 but less than 2 standard deviations above the mean, and so on, with an activity level of 10 corresponding to an ILI percentage 8 to 11 standard deviations above the mean. The very high levels correspond to an ILI percentage 12 to 15 standard deviations above the mean for level 11, 16 to 19 standard deviations above the mean for level 12, and 20 or more standard deviations above the mean for level 13. \n\nDisclaimers: \n\nThe ILI Activity Indicator map reflects the intensity of ILI activity, not the extent of geographic spread of ILI, within a jurisdiction. Therefore, outbreaks occurring in a single area could cause the entire jurisdiction to display high or very high activity levels. In addition, data collected in ILINet may disproportionally represent certain populations within a jurisdiction, and therefore, may not accurately depict the full picture of respiratory illness activity for the entire jurisdiction. Differences in the data presented here by CDC and independently by some health departments likely represent differing levels of data completeness with data presented by the health department likely being more complete. \n\nMore information is available on <a href=\"https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html\">FluView Interactive</a>.","title":"Outpatient Respiratory Illness Activity Map","programCode":["009:026"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/6svj-q4zv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/6svj-q4zv/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/6svj-q4zv/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/6svj-q4zv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/6svj-q4zv/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/6svj-q4zv/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/6svj-q4zv/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"US","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["Public Health Surveillance"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/6tk5-h85s","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-01-03","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2019-01-03","keyword":["klebsiella spp.","netss","nedss","2018","carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae","nndss","wonder","enterobacter spp.","escherichia coli"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/6tk5-h85s","description":"NNDSS - Table II.

This dataset includes 2017, 2016 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017, 2016), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017, 2012-2016 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, pap tests, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleep less than 7 hours) from the 2016 BRFSS that are the same in the 2019 release as the previous 2018 release.

Exposure to SSC dust has been linked to pulmonary health effects, including pulmonary fibrosis and lung inflammation. Previous studies have investigated the toxicity of SSC particles using in vitro and in vivo models, but these studies have limitations. For example, they often relied on pre-generated particles that may not accurately represent the size distribution and characteristics of aerosols encountered in real-world settings. Additionally, these models did not capture the co-exposure to VOCs that can occur during SSC fabrication.\nTo address these limitations, we developed a novel apparatus capable of real-time generation of SSC sawing particles and their simultaneous delivery to rodents via whole-body inhalation. This approach allows for a more accurate assessment of SSC toxicity under conditions that better reflect workplace exposure scenarios. The present study utilizes this system to characterize the acute pulmonary response in mice following a 4-day inhalation exposure to real-time generated SSC aerosols, with evaluations at 1, 6, 27, and 56 days post-exposure.","title":"Mouse pulmonary response following solid surface composite dust inhalation","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/766v-ysx3/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:20"],"landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/76u3-26ik","issued":"2024-11-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-11-20","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Health Effects Laboratory Division, Physical Effects Research Branch","hasEmail":"mailto:sa-cin-webteam@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/76u3-26ik","description":"To protect residential roofing construction workers from both fatal and musculoskeletal injuries, it is necessary to assess the musculoskeletal and biomechanical risks in residential roofing tasks. This undertaking requires accurate information of workers’ 3D body positions to analyze kinematics and kinetics of the human body. In this study, we proposed a novel 2- stage motion estimation approach based on a convolution neural network to estimate residential roofer’s body positions using three-view video data. Instead of pursuing end-to- end training, our approach includes two stages: (1) use a multi-view model to estimate the 3D pose in a single frame; (2) use a multi-frame model to apply temporal convolutions to refine the multi-view outputs. The performance of the approach was evaluated by comparing our estimation with the gold-standard marker-based 3D human pose estimation (“ground truth”). The evaluation results show that our marker-free video-based approach can accurately capture the 3D posture of workers during the common roofing task and the proposed multi-frame model can effectively improve the precision of the coordinate sequence. The values of mean per joint position error of estimated human position before and after processing by the multi-frame model are 27.93 and 24.81 mm, respectively. These results prove that the proposed marker-free motion capture estimation approach can efficiently and accurately locate 3D body joints and pave the way for future onsite musculoskeletal motion analysis during roofing activities.","title":"Video-Based 3D pose estimation for residential roofing-dataset","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/76u3-26ik/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/natality.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2016-08-03","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"2021-01-01/2025-06-30","modified":"2025-09-19","keyword":["preterm birth","vsrr","fertility rate","birth rate","cesarean delivery","vital statistics rapid release","nchs"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/76vv-a7x8","description":"Provisional estimates of selected reproductive indicators.

Exposure to toxic chemicals during the war, such as oil well fire smoke, pesticides, physiological stress, and nerve agents, is thought to have triggered abnormal neuroinflammatory responses that contribute to GWI. Previous studies using animal models have indicated that combined exposure to high physiological stress and GW-relevant organophosphates, such as sarin nerve agent and chlorpyrifos and dichlorvos, produces neuroinflammation and changes in diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures, suggesting a neuroimmune basis for GWI. In the current study, we examined brain structure and immune function of a chronic rat model of GWI and showed that a combination of long-term corticosterone treatment (CORT, to mimic high physiological stress) and diisopropyl fluorophosphate exposure (DFP, to mimic sarin exposure) resulted in elevations of multiple inflammatory cytokines, an increased activated microglial population, and disrupted brain microstructure in the hippocampal regions. Moreover, prior exposures to these agents modeling the “in-theater,” initiating exposure conditions experienced by veterans with GWI can induce long-term alterations in neuroimmune signaling, resulting in an exacerbated neuroinflammatory response to future immune challenges.  The goal of the study was to establish a long-term model of GWI in rats that would be more relevant to the current state of ill veterans.  As such, rats were initially exposed to the stress hormone corticosterone (CORT) for 1 week followed by a single exposure to the sarin surrogate diisopropyl fluorophosphate, to mimic “in-theater” conditions of high physiological stress and nerve agent exposure.  This initial exposure was followed up with 4 weeks of intermittent re-exposure to week-long bouts of CORT and a final exposure to the prototypical inflammagen, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mimic a systemic inflammatory challenge.","title":"Nerve agent exposure and physiological stress alter brain microstructure and immune profiles after inflammatory challenge in a long-term animal model of Gulf War Illness","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/7ehz-refy/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:00"],"landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/7esm-uptm","issued":"2016-01-07","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2018-01-19","keyword":["122 cities","2015","death","influenza","mortality","pneumonia"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/7esm-uptm","description":"TABLE III.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. * Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. ��� Case counts for reporting year 2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly. �� Data for meningococcal disease, invasive caused by serogroups ACWY; serogroup B; other serogroup; and unknown serogroup are available in Table I.","title":"NNDSS - Table II.

For all weeks, measles is considered imported if the disease was acquired outside of the United States and is considered indigenous if the disease was acquired anywhere within the United States or it is not known where the disease was acquired.\n\nNote:\nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html.\n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions.

This dataset consists of the event waveform files from the seismic network for the 983,379 events that were detected during the monitoring campaign. The waveforms are stored in HDF5 files that are broken up by week. Within the HDF5 files, the data are organized by station id, event time, and channel. The amplitudes are velocity in meters/second.\n \nThis is download 42 of 48 and corresponds to the time range between October 22, 2012, and October 29, 2012.","title":"Elk Creek Seismic Waveforms 2012 (Part 15 of 20)","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/82ug-d8mh/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/8396-v7yb","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-09-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"2021-08-16/2022-10-19","modified":"2025-02-23","references":["https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-County-Level-of-Community-Transmissi/nra9-vzzn"],"keyword":["ncird-corvd","community transmission","coronavirus","county","covid-19","laboratory","case"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC-INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"CDC"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8396-v7yb","description":"On October 20, 2022, CDC began retrieving aggregate case and death data from jurisdictional and state partners weekly instead of daily.

Similar to this dataset, the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">original historical dataset</a> is archived on 10/20/2022. It will continue to be publicly available but will no longer be updated. A new dataset containing historical community transmission data by county is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/jgk8-6dpn\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains reported daily transmission levels at the county level with the same values used to display transmission maps on the COVID Data Tracker. Each day, the dataset is appended to contain the most recent day's data. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests conducted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have a transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00).\n\nIf","title":"United States COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted - ARCHIVED","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8396-v7yb/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8396-v7yb/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8396-v7yb/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8396-v7yb/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8396-v7yb/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8396-v7yb/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8396-v7yb/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"US","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"No longer updated (dataset archived)","theme":["Public Health Surveillance"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:20"],"landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/83mw-v57c","issued":"2025-07-24","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-07-31","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:dqs@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/83mw-v57c","description":"List of footnotes, notes, and source information for NPALS Summary Statistics.

Data include demographic, clinical, and geographic information; data do not include direct identifiers. Two types of datasets of human Lyme disease case data collected through public health surveillance are available: one includes annual case count aggregated by county of residence according to specific demographic variables and one is line-listed with patient demographic factors, month of illness onset, and clinical presentation information but without corresponding geographic information. These privacy-protected datasets were implemented in accordance with methodology described in Lee et al. Protecting Privacy and Transforming COVID-19 Case Surveillance Datasets for Public Use. Public Health Rep. 2021 Sep-Oct;136(5):554-561. doi: 10.1177/00333549211026817. \n\nLyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991. Different surveillance case definitions have been in effect over time; details are available here: https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/conditions/lyme-disease/. In 2008, a probable case definition was included in public health surveillance for the first time. In 2022, states with a high incidence of Lyme disease started reporting cases based on laboratory evidence alone without requirement for a clinical investigation, precluding comparison with historical data (for more information: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7306a1.htm?s_cid=mm7306a1_w). As such, Lyme disease surveillance data are grouped into separate datasets based on when these major changes occurred; data are provided for download separately for 1992–2007, 2008–2021, and 2022 to current. Data will be updated annually upon final verification of Lyme disease surveillance data by health departments. \n\nData Limitations:\nSurveillance data have significant limitations that must be considered in the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.  \n       1. Under-reporting and misclassification are features common to all surveillance systems. Not every case of Lyme disease is reported to CDC, and some cases that are reported may be reflect illness due to another cause.  \n       2. Please note that before the 2022 surveillance case definition went into effect, several states with high Lyme disease incidence had initiated alternative methods of surveillance and those data were not reportable to CDC.\n       3. Final case data are subject to each state’s abilities to capture and classify cases, which is dependent upon budget and personnel. This can vary not only between states, but also from year to year within a given state. Consequently, a sudden or marked change in reported cases does not necessarily represent a true change in disease incidence. Every effort should be made to construct analyses to limit overinterpretation of this variation (see the following reference for more context:  Kugeler KJ, Eisen RJ.

1960. \n\nData availability varies by race and ethnicity groups. All birth data by race before 1980 are based on race of the child. Since 1980, birth data by race are based on race of the mother. For race, data are available for Black and White births since 1960, and for American Indians/Alaska Native and Asian/Pacific Islander births since 1980. Data on Hispanic origin are available since 1989. Teen birth rates for specific racial and ethnic categories are also available since 1989. From 2003 through 2015, the birth data by race were based on the “bridged” race categories (5). Starting in 2016, the race categories for reporting birth data changed; the new race and Hispanic origin categories are: Non-Hispanic, Single Race White; Non-Hispanic, Single Race Black; Non-Hispanic, Single Race American Indian/Alaska Native; Non-Hispanic, Single Race Asian; and, Non-Hispanic, Single Race Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (5,6). Birth data by the prior, “bridged” race (and Hispanic origin) categories are included through 2018 for comparison.\n\nSOURCES\n\nNCHS, National Vital Statistics System, birth data (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/births.htm); public-use data files (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/VitalStatsOnline.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov/).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

To better understand these events and manage their associated risks, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health undertook a long-term monitoring campaign at the Elk Creek Mine in the NFV. The monitoring efforts included a seismic network composed of both surface and underground sensors, borehole pressure cells (BPCs), instrumented support Cans, convergence monitors, ground condition surveys, and several other data sources. This dataset consists of the event waveform files from the seismic network for the 983,379 events that were detected during the monitoring campaign.

Accordingly, the model was designed to mimic an occupationally-relevant scenario in which inhalation of welding fumes (WF) constituted the primary occupational/environmental exposure of interest. Immune endpoints were assessed at three different time points representative of different stages in the exposure/response timeline (before WF exposure, directly after, and following a 12 wk recovery period). Moreover, the potential impact of genetic variation and lifestyle factors on the immune response to WF exposure and subsequent recovery was addressed by incorporating two different rat strains (Sprague-Dawley [SD] and Brown Norway [BN]) and two variations in diet (regular and high fat) into the model.\n\nOne of the primary objectives of this study was to determine whether consumption of a HF diet is associated with increased immunological responsivity following exposure to a common respiratory toxicant. The study was also executed with the goal of identifying which experimental factor (genetics/strain, diet, occupational exposure) is most influential in the modulation of local and systemic markers of immune status following WF exposure, and subsequently, the efficacy of inflammation resolution. The information obtained from these analyses will help elucidate which exposomic determinants may be particularly relevant in the context of immunotoxicity, and accordingly, warrant special attention in future investigations. The results will also contribute to the development of other in vivo exposome models and direct future efforts related to the exposome and its impact on human health.","title":"Examination of the exposome in an animal model: the impact of high fat diet and rat strain on local and systemic immune markers following occupational welding fume exposure","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/8ggw-jwph/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/8gpz-j2fr","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-07-16","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-08-07","conformsTo":"More information on Medicare restricted files can be found at https://resdac.org/","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DDT Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:ddtpubsmailbox@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8gpz-j2fr","description":"2021, 2022.

Measures related to these topic areas are further described and displayed in data dashboards here: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/namcs.htm.","title":"National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, 2020-2021, restricted physician-only data","isPartOf":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/namcs.htm","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/b3prosal/pp300.htm","mediaType":"text/html","description":"Standard application process link attached."}],"spatial":"United States","describedBy":"NAMCS is an annual survey of 3,000 physicians working in nonfederally employed, office-based settings in the 50 U.S. states or Washington, D.C., sampled from the American Medical Association and the American Osteopathic Association master files.

We assessed the variability of samples produced by our dynamic atmosphere generation system designed for VOC generation and sampling. The characterization of bias and variability was conducted across various atmospheres containing pure n-heptane as well as mixtures of VOCs, which were collected using coconut shell charcoal tubes. The analysis of VOCs from these charcoal tubes was evaluated to reveal the variability from multiple sources: the generation of the atmosphere, the sampling process, and the analytical procedures. This research aimed to quantify the extent of variability from these sources and to estimate the sampling variability associated with our dynamic generation system. Our findings indicated that sampling variability ranged from 2% for pure n-heptane to 12% for a component within a ten-VOC mixture. Notably, sample variability increased with lower concentration levels and in mixtures compared to single-component atmospheres. This study provides a foundational reference for future experiments focused on atmosphere sampling performance at lower concentrations and in mixed VOC environments.\n\nThe introduction above was rephrased by ChatGPT-4 (with training data up to April 2023) from the original work of: Doepke et al.

RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of telemedicine access and use for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about whether providers offered telemedicine (including video and telephone appointments) in the last 2 months—both during and before the pandemic—and about the use of telemedicine in the last 2 months during the pandemic. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, many local and state governments discouraged people from leaving their homes for nonessential reasons. Although health care is considered an essential activity, telemedicine offers an opportunity for care without the potential or perceived risks of leaving the home. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, added telemedicine questions to its sample adult questionnaire in July 2020.  The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/telemedicine-use.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of telemedicine use during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 3.1, which started on April 14, 2021). The Household Pulse Survey reports telemedicine use in the last 4 weeks among adults and among households with at least one child under age 18 years. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who have a usual place of care and a provider that offered telemedicine in the past 2 months, who used telemedicine in the past 2 months, or who have a usual place of care and a provider that offered telemedicine prior to the coronavirus pandemic.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. U: Unavailable.    -: No reported cases.    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.    Med: Median.    Max: Maximum. * Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. ��� Case counts for reporting year 2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. Data for TB are displayed in Table IV, which appears quarterly.","title":"NNDSS - Table II.

The medical abstract form and the automated data tapes contain items that relate to the personal characteristics of the patient. These items include age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, and expected sources of payment. Administrative items such as admission and discharge dates (which allow calculation of length of stay), as well as discharge status are also included.

To achieve this, generated test atmospheres must: enable simultaneous exposure of multiple samplers to equivalent atmospheres; maintain a continuous stable atmosphere for a duration to exceed experimental time frames; and produce a range of analyte concentrations, air velocities, temperatures and humidities. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (AGCIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) for PAA is 0.4 ppm. The goal was to generate PAA atmospheres with concentrations from one tenth of the TLV up to 100 times the TLV.\n\nPAA is a reactive chemical, which presents some inherent challenges to generation of standard reference materials and atmospheres. PAA is a strong oxidant. PAA solutions are labile, thus it is difficult to keep reference standards or atmospheres. In solution, PAA and water are in equilibrium with acetic acid (AA) and hydrogen peroxide (HP). The equilibrium shifts as solutions of PAA evolve oxygen gas through the degradation of HP. Dynamic PAA atmospheres which are flowing and continuously refreshed are the preferred method for exposing samplers to equivalent atmospheres. Generation of static atmospheres by evaporating PAA solution into a closed container cannot be maintained for very long before needing to be refreshed. Dynamically generated atmospheres are created by a continuously renewed flow of air as a carrier and a source of PAA vapors, which are necessary for evaluating sensor performance over time frames relevant to occupational safety.\n\nGeneration of PAA vapors can be accomplished from assisted vaporization, including applying heat and/or aerosolization with a nebulizer to accelerate evaporation. Glass reacts with PAA to hydroxylate the silica. used a glass syringe to deliver PAA solution to a nebulizer; however, gas bubbles formed in the syringe leading to uncontrollable ejection of the PAA solution from the syringe. To mitigate this, used acid washed syringes. They generated atmospheres of up to 2 ppm with a reported 95% recovery of theoretical delivered PAA. Dilute solutions of PAA can help to mitigate gas evolution but require more energy to evaporate and introduce additional humidity.\n\nFor these experiments, PAA vapors were swept directly from the headspace above a PAA solution into our generation system. The flow rate of the air sweeping the headspace was varied to achieve the desired concentration after dilution into the carrier gas stream. When evaporating diluted PAA solutions using a nebulizer, the minimum humidity range is limited due to the water content in the dilute PAA solution. Thus, a wider humidity range on the low end is available when sweeping the headspace. The ability to maintain the concentration of PAA in the headspace above the solution is limited by the kinetics at the PAA solution-air interface. A practical solution was achieved using a PAA delivery system where air was passed through the headspace above a PAA solution in a vial. An impinger with a N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine (DPD) analysis was used as the reference measurement for the PAA concentrations in the generated atmospheres.","title":"Controlled Generation of Peracetic Acid Atmospheres for the Evaluation of Chemical Samplers","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/9kpc-xntn/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"non-public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/data-research/facts-stats/surveillance-data-1.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-08-19","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-08-19","references":["https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/conditions/lyme-disease/"],"keyword":["lyme disease","surveillance"],"conformsTo":"NNDSS","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Bacterial Diseases Branch Epidemiology & Surveillance Team","hasEmail":"mailto:bdbepigroup@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9mtj-y2ba","description":"Overview:\nPublic health surveillance data are collected and reported voluntarily to CDC by U.S. states and territories through the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) (https://www.cdc.gov/nndss/index.html). Data include demographic, clinical, and geographic information; data do not include direct identifiers. Two types of datasets of human Lyme disease case data collected through public health surveillance are available: one includes annual case count aggregated by county of residence according to specific demographic variables and one is line-listed with patient demographic factors, month of illness onset, and clinical presentation information but without corresponding geographic information. These privacy-protected datasets were implemented in accordance with methodology described in Lee et al. Protecting Privacy and Transforming COVID-19 Case Surveillance Datasets for Public Use. Public Health Rep. 2021 Sep-Oct;136(5):554-561. doi: 10.1177/00333549211026817.\n\nLyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991. Different surveillance case definitions have been in effect over time; details are available here: https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/conditions/lyme-disease/. In 2008, a probable case definition was included in public health surveillance for the first time. In 2022, states with a high incidence of Lyme disease started reporting cases based on laboratory evidence alone without requirement for a clinical investigation, precluding comparison with historical data (for more information: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7306a1.htm?s_cid=mm7306a1_w). As such, Lyme disease surveillance data are grouped into separate datasets based on when these major changes occurred; data are provided for download separately for 1992–2007, 2008–2021, and 2022 to current. Data will be updated annually upon final verification of Lyme disease surveillance data by health departments.\n\nData Limitations:\nSurveillance data have significant limitations that must be considered in the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.\n1. Under-reporting and misclassification are features common to all surveillance systems. Not every case of Lyme disease is reported to CDC, and some cases that are reported may be reflect illness due to another cause.\n2. Please note that before the 2022 surveillance case definition went into effect, several states with high Lyme disease incidence had initiated alternative methods of surveillance and those data were not reportable to CDC.\n3. Final case data are subject to each state’s abilities to capture and classify cases, which is dependent upon budget and personnel. This can vary not only between states, but also from year to year within a given state. Consequently, a sudden or marked change in reported cases does not necessarily represent a true change in disease incidence. Every effort should be made to construct analyses to limit overinterpretation of this variation (see the following reference for more context: Kugeler KJ, Eisen RJ.

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations.

This dataset includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013, 2010-2014 estimates. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/500cities.\nNote: During the process of uploading the 2015 estimates, CDC found a data discrepancy in the published 500 Cities data for the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates caused when reformatting the SAS data file to the open data format. . The small area estimation model and code were correct.

Gas-phase reactions were prepared in Teflon chambers housing HOCl, Cl2, and limonene.  The resulting chemical products were collected and analyzed using gas-phase preconcentration following by gas chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry.  Several chlorinated products were detected including a limonene chlorohydrin and limonene species containing one, two, and three chlorines.  Product concentration and yields were estimated for the most abundant products, and greater than 80% of the transformed limonene was represented in the detected products.  Temporal sampling of the reactions allowed time courses to be plotted for limonene transformation and chlorinated limonene product generation under different conditions including the treatments of HOCl/Cl2, Cl2 only, high vs. low relative humidity, and +/- ozone. These experiments provide additional insight into the chemical transformations initiated by sodium hypochlorite bleach oxidants in the gas phase which may be of interest to human health.","title":"Factors affecting chlorinated product formation from sodium hypochlorite bleach and limonene reactions in the gas phase","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/9ziv-gyv9/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/9zr4-c7mm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-07-03","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-07-23","keyword":["industry"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"NIOSH Mining Program","hasEmail":"mailto:mining@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9zr4-c7mm","description":"Coal bursts (damaging seismic events in underground coal mines) pose a substantial threat to operations and mine workers.

The purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of hearing loss among U.S. industries.\n\nMethods: We examined 2000–2008 audiograms for male and female workers ages 18–65, who had higher occupational noise exposures than the general population. Prevalence and adjusted prevalence ratios (PRs) for hearing loss were estimated and compared across industries.\n\nResults: In our sample, 18% of workers had hearing loss. When compared with the Couriers and Messengers industry sub-sector, workers employed in Mining (PR = 1.65, CI = 1.57–1.73), Wood Product Manufacturing (PR = 1.65, CL = 1.61– 1.70), Construction of Buildings (PR = 1.59, CI = 1.51–1.68), and Real Estate and Rental and Leasing (PR = 1.61, CL = 1.51–1.71) had higher risks for hearing loss.\n\nConclusions: Workers in the Mining, Manufacturing, and Construction industries need better engineering controls for noise and stronger hearing conservation strategies. More hearing loss research is also needed within traditional ‘‘low-risk’’ industries like Real Estate.","title":"Prevalence of Hearing Loss in the United States by Industry, 2000-2008","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/a2mg-p2ni/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-05-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-07-10","references":["https://wwwdev.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/data/claims/marketscan.html","https://marketscan.truvenhealth.com/marketscanportal/"],"keyword":["claims","service utilization","eye exams","truven","diagnosed prevalence","marketscan","medical diagnoses"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DDT Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:ddtpubsmailbox@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/a35h-9yn4","description":"2016, 2021, 2023.

Data include demographic, clinical, and geographic information; data do not include direct identifiers. Two types of datasets of human Lyme disease case data collected through public health surveillance are available: one includes annual case count aggregated by county of residence according to specific demographic variables and one is line-listed with patient demographic factors, month of illness onset, and clinical presentation information but without corresponding geographic information. These privacy-protected datasets were implemented in accordance with methodology described in Lee et al. Protecting Privacy and Transforming COVID-19 Case Surveillance Datasets for Public Use. Public Health Rep. 2021 Sep-Oct;136(5):554-561. doi: 10.1177/00333549211026817.\n\nLyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991. Different surveillance case definitions have been in effect over time; details are available here: https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/conditions/lyme-disease/. In 2008, a probable case definition was included in public health surveillance for the first time. In 2022, states with a high incidence of Lyme disease started reporting cases based on laboratory evidence alone without requirement for a clinical investigation, precluding comparison with historical data (for more information: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7306a1.htm?s_cid=mm7306a1_w). As such, Lyme disease surveillance data are grouped into separate datasets based on when these major changes occurred; data are provided for download separately for 1992–2007, 2008–2021, and 2022 to current. Data will be updated annually upon final verification of Lyme disease surveillance data by health departments.\n\nData Limitations:\nSurveillance data have significant limitations that must be considered in the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.\n1. Under-reporting and misclassification are features common to all surveillance systems. Not every case of Lyme disease is reported to CDC, and some cases that are reported may be reflect illness due to another cause.\n2. Please note that before the 2022 surveillance case definition went into effect, several states with high Lyme disease incidence had initiated alternative methods of surveillance and those data were not reportable to CDC.\n3. Final case data are subject to each state’s abilities to capture and classify cases, which is dependent upon budget and personnel. This can vary not only between states, but also from year to year within a given state. Consequently, a sudden or marked change in reported cases does not necessarily represent a true change in disease incidence. Every effort should be made to construct analyses to limit overinterpretation of this variation (see the following reference for more context: Kugeler KJ, Eisen RJ.

Notably, the role of specific miRNAs during influenza virus infections are still ill-defined. The central goal of this study was to identify novel miRNAs and their target genes in response to influenza virus infections in airway epithelium. Human airway epithelial cells exposed to influenza virus induced several novel miRNAs that were identified using next generation sequencing (NGS) and their target genes by biochemical methods. NGS analysis predicted forty-two RNA sequences as possible miRNAs based on computational algorithms. Expression patterns of these putative miRNAs were further confirmed using RT-PCR in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) exposed to H1N1, H9N1(1P10) and H9N1 (1WF10) strains of influenza virus. A time course study showed significant downregulation of put-miR-34 in H1N1 and put-miR-35 in H9N1(1P10) infected cells, consistent with the NGS data. Additionally put-miR-34, and put-miR-35 showed a high fold enrichment in argonaute-immunoprecipitation compared to the controls, indicating their ability to form a complex with argonaute protein and RNA induced silencing complex (RISC), a typical mode of action found with miRNAs. Our earlier studies have shown that replication and survival of influenza virus is modulated by certain transcription factors, such as, NF-ĸB. To identify the target(s) of these putative miRNAs, we screened 84 transcription factors that have a role in viral pathogenesis. Cells transfected with mimic of the put-miR-34 showed significant decrease in expression of Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 3 (STAT3), and the inhibitor of put-miR-34 showed significant increase in STAT3 expression and its phosphorylation. In addition, put-miR-34 had 76% homology to the untranslated region (UTR) of STAT3. NGS and PCR array data submitted to the Gene Ontology also predicted the role of transcription factors modulated by put-miR-34. Our data suggests that put-miR-34 could be a good target for the antiviral therapy as the hyperactivation or inactivation of STAT3 results in viral disease, as tightly regulated STAT3 function is central to health.","title":"Influenza virus induced novel miRNAs regulate the STAT pathway","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/adnf-fpem/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-02-27","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-02-27","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealthdata/"],"keyword":["adults","access to care","tooth loss","dental visits","dental cleaning"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Oral Health Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:oralhealth@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aemk-wcbf","description":"Data from BRFSS for indicators of adult oral health for 1999 and even years from 2002 through 2010.

Considering the projected increase in the production and use of nanomaterials, a corresponding increase in occupational exposure to nanomaterials and their resulting adverse health effects should be anticipated among workers. There is substantial evidence in the literature, based on cell culture and animal studies, supporting the potential toxicity and detrimental health effects associated with exposure to nanomaterials. Intervention and/or prevention of adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to toxic nanomaterials will be a major concern for health providers and regulatory and non-regulatory government agencies as the use of nanomaterials expand. A key element in the intervention and/or prevention of the adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to toxic nanomaterials is a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pulmonary toxicity induced by nanomaterials.\n\nDue to its physicochemical and mechanical properties, nanocellulose has found many applications in manufactured goods in the paper and food industry, cosmetics, biomedicine, and pharmaceuticals. There is potential for human exposure to nanocellulose or products that contain nanocellulose both during the production and use of the materials that contain nanocellulose. The objectives of the current study were to determine lung toxicity potential of crystalline nanocellulose (CNC) and the molecular mechanisms underlying the toxicity. A rat inhalation exposure model was employed to determine the lung toxicity potential of CNC. Global gene expression profile in the lung and bioinformatic analysis of the gene expression data were conducted to determine the molecular mechanisms underlying the CNC-induced lung toxicity.","title":"Lung toxicity and gene expression changes in response to whole-body inhalation exposure to cellulose nanocrystal in rats","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/aeq9-xksa/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/adultvaxview/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-07-28","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-01-22","keyword":["vaccination coverage","vaccination","pneumococcal","immunization","tdap","vaxviews","zoster","td","shingles"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"VaxView Team","hasEmail":"mailto:VaxView@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aetd-68ew","description":"Vaccination Coverage among Adults (18+ Years)\n\n• Data on adult vaccination coverage from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for the general population at the national, regional, and state levels by age groups.\n\n• Additional information available at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/adultvaxview/index.html","title":"Vaccination Coverage among Adults (18+ Years)","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aetd-68ew/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aetd-68ew/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aetd-68ew/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aetd-68ew/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aetd-68ew/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aetd-68ew/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aetd-68ew/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"theme":["Vaccinations"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2024-09-27","temporal":"1997/2022","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-06-24","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:healthus@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aewi-gwni","description":"Data on asthma in children younger than age 18 in the United States, by selected characteristics.

The collector implements a water-based, laminar-flow, condensation growth technique, followed by impaction onto an optical/electron microscopy substrate or a transmission electron microscopy grid for direct analysis. The compact design employs three parallel growth tubes allowing a sampling flow rate of 1.2 L min-1. Each of the three growth tubes consists of three-temperature regions, for controlling the water vapor saturation profile and exit dew point. Following the droplet growth, the three streams merge into one flow and a converging nozzle enhances focusing of the grown droplets into a tight beam, prior to their final impaction on the warm surface of the collection substrate. A miniscule sample deposition area is attained for effective coupling with microscopic and spectroscopic analysis. Experiments were conducted for the acquisition of the size-dependent collection efficiency, the uniformity of the spot deposit, the surface density distribution of the collected particles, and the aerosol concentration effect on the triple-tube NanoSpotTM Collector. Particles as small as 7 nm could be activated and collected on the electron microscopy stub. A spot deposit of approximately 0.7-mm diameter is formed for particles over a broad particle diameter range. The collected particle samples were analyzed using electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy for the acquisition of the particle spatial distribution, the spot sample uniformity, and the analyte concentration. Finally, the NanoSpotTM collector’s analytical measurement sensitivity for laser Raman analysis and the counting statistics for fiber count measurement using optical microscopy were calculated and were compared with those of the conventional aerosol sampling methods.","title":"NanoSpotTM Collector for Aerosol Sample Collection for Direct Microscopy and Spectroscopy Analysis-Dataset","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/b68w-a53h/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:20"],"landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/b6fe-yq88","issued":"2024-11-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-11-20","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Health Effects Laboratory Division, Chemical and Biological Monitoring Branch","hasEmail":"mailto:sa-cin-webteam@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/b6fe-yq88","description":"A method for measuring PAA vapors in air using impinger sampling and field-portable colorimetric analysis is presented.

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2010 ZCTA boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the ZCTA level.

The underground coal mines in Colorado’s North Fork Valley (NFV) have experienced many coal bursts, often with distinct characteristics from those of other US coal mining regions. To better understand these events and manage their associated risks, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health undertook a long-term monitoring campaign at the Elk Creek Mine in the NFV.

This expansion of the NAMCS physician sampling frame is due to concerns that NAMCS was not covering visits made to office-based practices which are owned by hospitals, and to increases in reported hospital purchases of physician practices in recent years.","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"Database will not be updated again.","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/bkcm-ybyk","issued":"2024-07-23","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-07-23","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Disability and Health Data System (CDC)","hasEmail":"mailto:no-reply@data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bkcm-ybyk","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"description":"","title":"dhds_dataset","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bkcm-ybyk/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bkcm-ybyk/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bkcm-ybyk/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bkcm-ybyk/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bkcm-ybyk/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bkcm-ybyk/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bkcm-ybyk/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/bkwy-pyv3","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-24","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-02","keyword":["serogroup b","wonder","serogroups acwy","nndss","netss","nedss","meningococcal disease","all serogroups","2019"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bkwy-pyv3","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1W.

The biodynamic responses, such as vibration stress, strain, and power absorption density, of the rat tails can be used to help evaluate the health effects related to vibration and force and to establish a dose-effect relationship. While the biodynamic responses of cadaver rat tails have been investigated, the objective of the current study was to determine whether the biodynamic responses of living rat tails are different from those of cadaver rat tails, and whether the biodynamic responses of both living and cadaver tails change with exposure duration. To make direct comparisons, the responses of both cadaver and living rat tails were examined on four different testing stations. The transfer function of each tail under a given contact force (2 N) was measured at each frequency in the one-third octave bands from 20 to 1000 Hz, and used to calculate the mechanical system parameters of the tails. The transfer function was also measured at different exposure durations to determine the time dependency of the response. The biodynamic responses of both cadaver and living rat tails, and the modeling results and time dependency are presented in a manuscript of this study (Warren et al., 2024), the original datasets measured in each trial of the tests are documented in this data description.","title":"Rat-Tail Models for Studying Hand-Arm Vibration Syndrome:  A Comparison between Living and Cadaver Rat Tails","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/bucw-etpd/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/bugr-bbfr","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-10-27","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-09-25","keyword":["providers","flu vaccination","flu shot","flu","vaccination sites","vaccinefinder","vaccination locations","vaccines"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC","hasEmail":"mailto:vaccinefinder@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bugr-bbfr","description":"Because inventory reporting is no longer required, Vaccines.gov information will not be updated on this site after July 2024.","title":"Vaccines.gov: Flu vaccinating provider locations","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bugr-bbfr/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bugr-bbfr/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bugr-bbfr/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bugr-bbfr/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bugr-bbfr/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bugr-bbfr/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bugr-bbfr/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"theme":["Flu Vaccinations"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dph/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-10-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-02-26","references":["https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html","https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/library/handbooks/general.html"],"keyword":["places","zcta","non-medical factor","acs","estimates"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"PLACES Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:places@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bumh-rgsq","description":"This dataset contains ZCTA-level non-medical factor measures from the American Community Survey 5-year data for the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia.

Exposure to Aspergillus species, as well as other environmental fungi, has been linked to adverse health outcomes including asthma, allergy, and even local or disseminated infection. However, the pulmonary immunological mechanisms associated with repeated exposure to A. versicolor have remained relatively uncharacterized. Here, A. versicolor was cultured and desiccated on rice, then placed in an acoustical generator system to achieve aerosolization. Mice were challenged with titrated doses of aerosolized conidia to examine deposition, lymphoproliferative properties, and then the immunotoxicological response to repeated inhalation exposures. The necessary dose to induce lymphoproliferation, but not infection-like pathology, was identified. Further, it was determined that the dose was able to initiate localized immune responses. The data presented in this study demonstrate an optimized and reproducible method for delivering A. versicolor conidia to rodents via nose-only inhalation. Additionally, the feasibility of a long-term repeated exposure study was established.  This experimental protocol can be used in future studies to investigate physiological effects of repeated pulmonary exposure to fungal conidia utilizing a practical and relevant mode of delivery. In total, these data constitute an important foundation for subsequent research in the field.","title":"Optimization of Aspergillus versicolor culture and aerosolization in a murine model of inhalational fungal exposure","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/bwwd-cuna/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-05-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-05-15","references":["https://wwwdev.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/data/claims/medicaid.html","https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/index.html"],"keyword":["medicaid","max","medical diagnoses","screening","service utilization","eye exams","diagnosed prevalence","claims"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DDT Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:ddtpubsmailbox@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/bwx3-gx66","description":"2016-2019.

The adjusted risk of incident hearing loss within each time period and industry sector as compared with a reference time period was also estimated.\n\nResults: The adjusted risk for incident hearing loss decreased over time when all industry sectors were combined.

We describe the design and characterization of a compact, high flow, Turbulent-mixing Condensation Aerosol-in-Liquid Concentrator (TCALC) that allows direct collection of aerosols as liquid suspensions, for off-line chemical, biological, or microscopy analysis. The TCALC unit, measuring approximately 12 × 16 × 18 cm, operates at an aerosol sample flowrate of up to 10 L min-1, using rapid mixing of a hot flow saturated with water vapor and a cold aerosol sample flow, thereby promoting condensational growth of aerosol particles. We investigated the effect of operating parameters such as vapor temperature, growth tube wall temperature, and aerosol sample flowrate, along with the effect of particle diameter, inlet humidity, aerosol concentration, and operation time on TCALC performance. Nanoparticles with an initial aerodynamic diameter ≥ 25 nm could grow to droplet diameters > 1400 nm with an efficiency ≥ 80%. Good droplet growth efficiency was achieved for sampled aerosol relative humidity ≥ 9%. We measured complete aerosol collection for concentrations of ≤ 3×105 cm-3. The results showed good agreement between the particulate mass collected through the liquid collector and direct filter collection. The TCALC eliminates the need for sample preparation and filter digestion during chemical analysis, thereby increasing sample recovery and substantially improving the limit of detection and sensitivity of off-line trace analysis of collected liquid samples.","title":"A High-throughput, Turbulent-mixing, Condensation Aerosol Concentrator for Direct Aerosol Collection as a Liquid Suspension","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/c75w-3h6e/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dph/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-06-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-08-25","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html"],"keyword":["zip code","status","risk","prevention","prevalence","places","outcomes","health","gis","behaviors","zcta"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"PLACES Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:places@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/c76y-7pzg","description":"This dataset contains model-based ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level estimates for the PLACES 2022 release in GIS-friendly format.

All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all “Patients using their own eggs” or for “Patients with no prior ART using their own eggs.” For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent’s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer.

Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the place level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=024cf3f6f59e49fe8c70e0e5410fe3cf","title":"PLACES: Place Data (GIS Friendly Format), 2021 release","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cj8b-94cj/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cj8b-94cj/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cj8b-94cj/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cj8b-94cj/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cj8b-94cj/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cj8b-94cj/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cj8b-94cj/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"theme":["500 Cities & Places"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://ephtracking.cdc.gov/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2015-08-13","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2018-06-05","keyword":["regulatory resources","air pollution","air quality","air quality index","air quality system","caa 109: clean air act section 109","daily 24 hour average concentration","daily maximum 8 hour average concentration","environmental hazard","environmental health","hourly observations","national ambient air quality standards","national environmental health tracking network","o3","oxygen","ozone","ozone residual","ozone - residual","particle pollution","particulate matter","particulate matter < 2.5 um","particulate matter - pm2.5","pm2.5","pm2.5 - local conditions","pm fine 0-2.5 um stp","site monitoring data","tracking","tracking network","tracking program"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Craig Kassinger","hasEmail":"mailto:cak8@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Environmental Health Tracking Network"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cjae-szjv","description":"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) provides air pollution data about ozone and particulate matter (PM2.5) to CDC for the Tracking Network. The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \"gold standard\" for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include \"Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)\".

Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 40 measures: 12 for health outcomes, 7 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, 3 for health status, and 7 for health-related social needs. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2020 population data, and American Community Survey 2018–2022 estimates.

Recent indoor assessments have identified Basidiomycota yeasts, including non-pathogenic species such as Vishniacozyma victoriae (syn. Cryptococcus victoriae), to be prevalent and potentially associated with asthma. However, the pulmonary immune response to repeated V. victoriae exposure was previously unexplored. This study aimed to compare the immunological impact of repeated pulmonary exposure to pathogenic and non-pathogenic Cryptococcus yeasts. Mice were repeatedly exposed to either C. neoformans, V. victoriae, or PBS control, and the immune responses were analyzed by measuring histopathological scores, and quantifications of immune cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or lung via flow cytometry, and cytokine concentrations in the lung. These findings highlight the importance of in vivo characterizations of exposures to frequently detected fungal organisms.","title":"Persisting Cryptococcus Yeast Species Vishniacozyma victoriae and Cryptococcus neoformans Elicit Unique Airway Inflammation in Mice Following Repeated Exposure","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/cygf-tgyd/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/cz39-ahbn","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2019-05-30","keyword":["eastern equine encephalitis virus disease","2019","nndss","neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive","wonder","arboviral diseases","anthrax","chikungunya virus disease","netss","nedss"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cz39-ahbn","description":"NNDSS - Table 1A.

Masonry workers often perform these tasks daily using an elevated work platform (e.g., mast climbers). Mast climbers are elevating equipment used to replace traditional scaffolds. They have been available in the United States since the 1980s.  Mast climbers are capable of handling much greater loads of workers and materials than traditional scaffolding. They also make reaching greater heights much easier, thereby improving efficiency on construction projects. However, working on an unstable work platform at elevation can increase the risks of slips, trips and falls, including falls to a lower level. From 1990 to 2017, there were a total of 35 recorded fatalities associated with the use of mast climbers. Of the 35 fatalities, 13 were masonry workers (OSHA report).  Additionally, working on a mast climber can also create awkward working postures due to the confined nature of the workspace. Masonry work can be physically demanding. Concrete block can weigh between 9-27 kg. The rate of overexertion among masonry workers was 33.4 per 10,000 FTEs compared to the average rate of 21.5 per 10,000 FTEs in all industries (BLS data). Shoulder-assist exoskeletons present an attractive possibility to reduce MSD risks in masonry workers if the exoskeletons do not cause adverse effects to the workers’ stability and balance. \n\nIn this study, we evaluated effects of three models of passive shoulder-assist exoskeletons on balance and shoulder muscle activity during a masonry task on a simulated mast climbing work platform. The balance-related parameters and shoulder muscle activities were compared when using or not using the exoskeletons. We want to evaluate the hypotheses that the exoskeletons (1) reduce shoulder muscle activity and (2) decrease the stability of the workers.","title":"Shoulder-Assist Exoskeleton Effects on Balance and Muscle Activity During a Block-laying Task on a Simulated Mast Climber","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/d29v-yfc2/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/BRFSS/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-07-19","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-09-19","references":["http://www.cdc.gov/BRFSS/"],"keyword":["survey","surveillance","risk","factor","brfss","behavioral","age-adjusted"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DPH Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:PublicInquiriesDPH@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/d2rk-yvas","description":"2011 to present.

These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people.

This gold standard animal model can recapitulate many clinical signs of infection present in IAV-infected humans, supports virus replication of human and zoonotic strains without prior adaptation, and permits evaluation of virus transmissibility by multiple modes. While ferrets have been employed in risk assessment settings for >20 years, results from this work are typically reported in discrete stand-alone publications, making aggregation of raw data from this work over time nearly impossible. Here, we describe a dataset of 333 ferrets inoculated with 107 unique IAV, conducted by a single research group (NCIRD/ID/IPB/Pathogenesis Laboratory Team) under a uniform experimental protocol. This collection of ferret tissue viral titer data on a per-individual ferret level represents a companion dataset to ‘An aggregated dataset of serially collected influenza A virus morbidity and titer measurements from virus-infected ferrets’. However, care must be taken when combining datasets at the level of individual animals (see PMID 40245007 for guidance in best practices for comparing datasets comprised of serially-collected and fixed-timepoint in vivo-generated data).\n\nSee publications using and describing data for more information:\nKieran TJ, Sun X, Tumpey TM, Maines TR, Belser JA. 202X.

DPM is a known carcinogen encountered in many industrial workplaces (notably mining) and in the ambient atmosphere. The method described here collects DPM particles onto a quartz fiber filter, after which reflection-mode infrared spectra are measured on a mid-infrared Fourier transform (FT-IR) spectrometer. Several infrared absorption bands are investigated for their efficacy in quantifying OC and EC. The thermo-optical (T-O) method is used to calibrate a linear regression model to predict OC and EC from the infrared spectra. The calibrated model, generated from laboratory DPM samples, is then utilized to quantify OC and EC in\nmine samples obtained from two metal mine locations under a variety of operating conditions. The feasibility of further improving these results by partial least squares (PLS) regression was investigated. A single calibration that is broadly applicable would be considered an improvement over currently available portable instruments, which require aerosol-specific calibration.","title":"DPM OC, EC and FT-IR data (Quantifying elemental and organic carbon in diesel particulate matter by mid infrared spectrometry).","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/dgwc-f5xf/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/vaccine-hesitancy","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2021-05-13","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-06-17","keyword":["vaccine hesitancy","coronavirus","covid-19"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"HHS","hasEmail":"mailto:joel.ruhter@hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"HHS/ASPE"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/djj9-kh3p","description":"Due to the change in the survey instrument regarding intention to vaccinate, our estimates for “hesitant or unsure” or “hesitant” derived from April 14-26, 2021, are not directly comparable with prior Household Pulse Survey data and should not be used to examine trends in hesitancy.\n\nTo support state and local communication and outreach efforts, ASPE developed state, county, and sub-state level predictions of hesitancy rates(https://aspe.hhs.gov/pdf-report/vaccine-hesitancy) using the most recently available federal survey data.\n\nWe estimate hesitancy rates at the state level using the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey (HPS)(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/household-pulse-survey.html) data and utilize the estimated values to predict hesitancy rates in more granular areas using the Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS)(https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html).

United States death counts and rates include the 50 states, plus the District of Columbia. \n\nDeaths with confirmed or presumed COVID-19, coded to ICD–10 code U07.1. Number of deaths reported in this file are the total number of COVID-19 deaths received and coded as of the date of analysis and may not represent all deaths that occurred in that period. Counts of deaths occurring before or after the reporting period are not included in the file.\n\nData during recent periods are incomplete because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes. This delay can range from 1 week to 8 weeks or more, depending on the jurisdiction and cause of death.\n\nDeath counts should not be compared across jurisdictions. Data timeliness varies by state. Some states report deaths on a daily basis, while other states report deaths weekly or monthly. \n\nThe ten (10) United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) regions include the following jurisdictions. Region 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont; Region 2: New Jersey, New York; Region 3: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia; Region 4: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee; Region 5: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin; Region 6: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas; Region 7: Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska; Region 8: Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, Wyoming; Region 9: Arizona, California, Hawaii, Nevada; Region 10: Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, Washington.\n\nRates were calculated using the population estimates for 2021, which are estimated as of July 1, 2021 based on the Blended Base produced by the US Census Bureau in lieu of the April 1, 2020 decennial population count. The Blended Base consists of the blend of Vintage 2020 postcensal population estimates, 2020 Demographic Analysis Estimates, and 2020 Census PL 94-171 Redistricting File (see https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2020-2021/methods-statement-v2021.pdf).\n\nRate are based on deaths occurring in the specified week and are age-adjusted to the 2000 standard population using the direct method (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr70/nvsr70-08-508.pdf). These rates differ from annual age-adjusted rates, typically presented in NCHS publications based on a full year of data and annualized weekly age-adjusted rates which have been adjusted to allow comparison with annual rates. Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly) rate prevailed for a full year.\n\nSub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).","title":"Provisional COVID-19 death counts and rates, by jurisdiction of residence and demographic characteristics","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/dmnu-8erf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/dmnu-8erf/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/dmnu-8erf/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/dmnu-8erf/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/dmnu-8erf/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/dmnu-8erf/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/dmnu-8erf/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"United States","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2022-04-28","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"1997-01-01/2018-12-31","modified":"2025-04-21","keyword":["continental population groups","american natives","alaskan natives","age","african americans","sdoh-high-school","sdoh-poverty-income","sex","sdoh-access-to-health-care","schools","prescriptions","prescription drugs","poverty","oceanic ancestry group","medically uninsured","medicaid","hispanic americans","health us","sdoh-higher-eduaction","health insurance","european continental ancestry group","dental care","asian continental ancestry group"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:healthus@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/dmzy-x2ad","description":"Data on delay or nonreceipt of needed medical care, nonreceipt of needed prescription drugs, or nonreceipt of needed dental care during the past 12 months due to cost by selected population characteristics.

For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>).

The goal of this study was to determine if inhalation of particulate and toxic chemicals generated during printing with polycarbonate (PC) plastic affected the neuroendocrine system.  Male rats were exposed to 3D-printer emissions (500 µg/cm3) or filtered air for 1, 4, 8, 15 or 30d for 4d/week (4h/day).  The effects of these exposures on hormone concentrations, and markers of function, injury and/or oxidative stress in the olfactory bulb, hypothalamus and testes were measured after 1, 8 and 30d of exposure.  Thirty days of exposure to 3D-emissions resulted in reductions in  thyroid stimulating hormone, follicle stimulating hormone and prolactin.  These changes were accompanied by increases in markers of cell injury and reductions in active mitochondria in the olfactory bulb, gonadotropin releasing hormone cells and fibers and tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabeled fibers in the arcuate nucleus, and reductions in spermatogonium.  PC plastics contain high concentrations bisphenol A and these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the health effects of inhaling 3D-printer emissions may be due to bisphenol A.","title":"Inhalation of polycarbonate emissions generated during 3D printing processes affects neuroendocrine function in male rats","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/dtz3-sij3/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dph/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-06-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-08-25","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html"],"keyword":["behaviors","status","risk","prevention","prevalence","places","outcomes","health","county","brfss"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"PLACES Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:places@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/duw2-7jbt","description":"This dataset contains model-based county-level estimates for the PLACES 2022 release.

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2018 or 2017 county population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

Data include demographic, clinical, and geographic information; data do not include direct identifiers. Two types of datasets of human Lyme disease case data collected through public health surveillance are available: one includes annual case count aggregated by county of residence according to specific demographic variables and one is line-listed with patient demographic factors, month of illness onset, and clinical presentation information but without corresponding geographic information. These privacy-protected datasets were implemented in accordance with methodology described in Lee et al. Protecting Privacy and Transforming COVID-19 Case Surveillance Datasets for Public Use. Public Health Rep. 2021 Sep-Oct;136(5):554-561. doi: 10.1177/00333549211026817.\n\nLyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991. Different surveillance case definitions have been in effect over time; details are available here: https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/conditions/lyme-disease/. In 2008, a probable case definition was included in public health surveillance for the first time. In 2022, states with a high incidence of Lyme disease started reporting cases based on laboratory evidence alone without requirement for a clinical investigation, precluding comparison with historical data (for more information: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7306a1.htm?s_cid=mm7306a1_w). As such, Lyme disease surveillance data are grouped into separate datasets based on when these major changes occurred; data are provided for download separately for 1992–2007, 2008–2021, and 2022 to current. Data will be updated annually upon final verification of Lyme disease surveillance data by health departments.\n\nData Limitations:\nSurveillance data have significant limitations that must be considered in the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.\n1. Under-reporting and misclassification are features common to all surveillance systems. Not every case of Lyme disease is reported to CDC, and some cases that are reported may be reflect illness due to another cause.\n2. Please note that before the 2022 surveillance case definition went into effect, several states with high Lyme disease incidence had initiated alternative methods of surveillance and those data were not reportable to CDC.\n3. Final case data are subject to each state’s abilities to capture and classify cases, which is dependent upon budget and personnel. This can vary not only between states, but also from year to year within a given state. Consequently, a sudden or marked change in reported cases does not necessarily represent a true change in disease incidence. Every effort should be made to construct analyses to limit overinterpretation of this variation (see the following reference for more context: Kugeler KJ, Eisen RJ.

Provisional rates which are an early estimate of the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, are shown as of the date specified and may not include all deaths and births that occurred during a given time period (see Technical Notes).\n\nA maternal death is the death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy irrespective of the duration and the site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes. In this data visualization, maternal deaths are those deaths with an underlying cause of death assigned to International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) code numbers A34, O00–O95, and O98–O99.\n\nThe provisional data  include reported 12 month-ending provisional maternal mortality rates overall, by age, and by race and Hispanic origin. Provisional maternal mortality rates presented in this data visualization are for “12-month ending periods,” defined as the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2020 would include deaths and births occurring from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2020. Evaluation of trends over time should compare estimates from year to year (June 2020 and June 2021), rather than month to month, to avoid overlapping time periods. In the visualization and in the accompanying data file, rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with current NCHS standards of reliability for rates. Death counts between 1-9 in the data file are suppressed in accordance with National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) confidentiality standards.\n\nProvisional data presented on this page will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional records are received. Previously released estimates are revised to include data and record updates received since the previous release. As a result, the reliability of estimates for a 12-month period ending with a specific month will improve with each quarterly release and estimates for previous time periods may change as new data and updates are received.","title":"VSRR Provisional Maternal Death Counts and Rates","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e2d5-ggg7/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e2d5-ggg7/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e2d5-ggg7/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e2d5-ggg7/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e2d5-ggg7/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e2d5-ggg7/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e2d5-ggg7/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"United States","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"R/P3M","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/datasets_documentation_related.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"rights":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/datasets_documentation_related.htm","issued":"2025-03-06","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"2016-2022","modified":"2025-09-02","references":["https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Datasets/NHAMCS/"],"keyword":["diagnosis","emergency department","healthcare access and utilization","visit characteristics","reason for visit","patient characteristics"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:CDCINFO@CDC.GOV"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e4ec-z5aa","description":"These data include counts and rates of emergency department visits from 2016-2022 for selected primary diagnoses and reasons for visit, stratified by selected patient and hospital characteristics.\nSearch, visualize, and download these and other estimates from a wide range of health topics with the NCHS Data Query System (DQS), available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/dataquery/index.htm.","title":"DQS Estimate of Emergency Department Visits in the United States, 2016-2022","isPartOf":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/datasets_documentation_related.htm","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e4ec-z5aa/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e4ec-z5aa/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e4ec-z5aa/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e4ec-z5aa/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e4ec-z5aa/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e4ec-z5aa/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/e4ec-z5aa/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"United States","describedBy":"ftp.cdc.gov - /pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/NHAMCS/","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"Annually.

Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch.

The dataset includes estimates for 40 measures: 12 for health outcomes, 7 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, 3 for health status, and 7 for health-related social needs. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2020 population data, and American Community Survey 2018–2022 estimates.

The goal of the study was to evaluate the potential for the β-adrenergic receptor inhibitor and anti-inflammatory drug, propranolol, to treat neuroinflammation in a novel long-term mouse model of GWI. We established that our long-term GWI model produces enhanced and prolonged neuroinflammation that is dependent upon Gulf War-relevant organophosphate exposure. Propranolol treatment abrogated the neuroinflammation instigated in our model specifically, having no treatment effects in non-DFP exposed groups. Our results indicate that propranolol may be a promising therapy for GWI by treating the underlying neuroinflammation associated with Gulf War-relevant physiological stress and organophosphate exposures.","title":"The β-adrenergic receptor blocker and anti-inflammatory drug propranolol mitigates brain cytokine expression in a long-term model of Gulf War Illness","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/eddk-effy/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dph/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-10-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-02-26","references":["https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html","https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/library/handbooks/general.html"],"keyword":["estimates","acs","places","place","non-medical factor"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"PLACES Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:places@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/edkk-ze78","description":"This dataset contains place-level (incorporated and census-designated places) non-medical factor measures from the American Community Survey 5-year data for the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia.

Asthma, a chronic respiratory disease, is notably characterized by reversible airway obstruction, persistent lung inflammation, and airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR).  Nasal insufflation of IL-11 causes AHR in wild-type mice while lung inflammation induced by antigen sensitization and challenge, which mimics features of atopic asthma in humans, is attenuated in mice genetically deficient in IL-11 receptor subunit alpha-1 (IL-11Rα1-deficient mice), a transmembrane receptor that is required along with glycoprotein 130 to transduce IL-11 intracellular signaling.  Nevertheless, the contribution of IL-11Rα1 to the manifestation of phenotypic features of non-atopic asthma are not presently known. Thus, based on the aforementioned observations, we hypothesized that genetic deficiency of IL-11Rα1 would attenuate lung inflammation and increases in airway responsiveness following acute inhalation exposure to ozone, a criteria pollutant and non-atopic asthma stimulus.","title":"Interleukin-11 Receptor Subunit Alpha-1 is Required for Maximal Airway Responsiveness to Methacholine After Acute Exposure to Ozone","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/ef89-9ik2/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/efb8-zbb7","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2020-01-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-01-07","keyword":["2020","nedss","netss","nndss","tuberculosis","tularemia","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/efb8-zbb7","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1JJ.

The team also conducted a survey from February to March 2018 using a semi-structured observation form in all shops (N=716) of all retail LBMs (N=35) in Dhaka city consisting of at least 10 shops. During the survey, they collected data on various equipment used for containing slaughtered poultry during exsanguination and mechanical defeathering, average weight of slaughtered broiler chickens, and average temperature of hot water used for scalding.

All four datasets may be linked by “ClinicID.” ClinicID is a unique identifier for each clinic that reported cycles. The Success Rates dataset contains success rates for ART cycles started during the year indicated. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using their own eggs or donor eggs, success rates are included separately for these two groups. Success rates for patients using their own eggs are shown per intended retrieval, per actual retrieval, and per transfer. These success rates are reported as cumulative success rates, which take into account transfers that occur within 1 year after an egg retrieval. Since ART success depends on whether patients are using ART for the first time or had prior ART cycles, users can examine success rates for all “Patients using their own eggs” or for “Patients with no prior ART using their own eggs.” For new patients using ART for the first time, the success rates are also shown after 1, 2, or all intended egg retrievals during the reporting year. In addition, the average number of transfers per intended retrieval and the average number of intended retrievals per live-birth delivery are shown. Success rates for ART cycles that involve the transfer of embryos created from donor eggs or donated embryos are shown and are not cumulative. They are based on donor cycles started in the year indicated that had embryo transfers, regardless of when the donor eggs were retrieved. Success rates in this section are not presented by patient age group because previous data show that an intended parent’s age does not substantially affect success when using donor eggs or donated embryos. The success rates are presented by types of embryos and eggs used in the transfer.

By tracking symptoms and conditions reported by patients in emergency departments (EDs), public health officials can monitor trends in critical areas. When people seek treatment in the ED, the facility sends de-identified data—including chief complaint, diagnosis codes, patient characteristics, and location—to state and local health departments to share with CDC.    \n \n\n<b>Indicator definitions</b>: Definitions include both (1) visits with acute mental health crises or evaluations where the sole or primary reason for the visit is related to mental health, and (2) visits where a mental health condition may not be the sole reason for the visit but was noted to be present in the discharge diagnosis or chief complaint.  \n\nED data are displayed as rates.    \n\n* The rate explains the number of ED visits related to a specific mental health condition out of every 100,000 ED visits.  The monthly rate of ED visits related to a condition is calculated as the number of ED visits related to a condition as a fraction of the total number of ED visits in a given month multiplied by 100,000. ED visits with and without mental health conditions where patients were under 12 years old and where age, sex, and race and ethnicity were unknown were included in the denominators when calculating rates for the overall population.  \n\n* Rates are also calculated within demographic groups such as age, sex, and race and ethnicity. This is done by comparing the number of ED visits related to a condition within a demographic group as a fraction of the total number of ED visits for that demographic group in a given month multiplied by 100,000. \n\n \n\n<b>Data quality and methodology</b>: More than 6,900 health care facilities covering 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam contribute data to NSSP daily. More than 80% of U.S. emergency departments send data to NSSP. Data are collected continuously, and for the purposes of this data channel, updated monthly. Monthly counts that are less than 10 either for the complete population or for specific demographic groups are not shown to protect confidentiality and privacy. Note, rate information may change as data are dynamically adjusted as electronic health record information is updated. However, these changes will not typically affect overall trends.   \n\n \n<b>For additional information, please see</b>: <a href = \"https://www.cdc.gov/mental-health/about-data/mental-health-data-sources.html\" target =\"_blank\">Mental Health Data Sources</a>. \n \nUpdated monthly. ","title":"National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP) Mental Health-Related Emergency Department Visit Rates","programCode":["009:033"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/eze9-ahe5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/eze9-ahe5/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/eze9-ahe5/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/eze9-ahe5/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/eze9-ahe5/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/eze9-ahe5/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/eze9-ahe5/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"U.S.","accrualPeriodicity":"R/P1M","theme":["Mental Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/index.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2020-09-04","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-04-21","keyword":["mortality","deaths","diabetes","kidney disease","diseases of heart","hhs region","nchs","nvss","influenza","pneumonia","provisional","respiratory disease","septicemia","united states","age","covid-19","coronavirus","chronic lower respiratory disease","cerebrovascular disease","causes of death","cancer","alzheimer disease","age group","all causes","monthly","natural cause"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ezfr-g6hf","description":"Provisional counts of deaths by the month the deaths occurred, by age group and HHS region, for select underlying causes of death for 2019-2020.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

In this paper, the melted substance is metal wire generated by an electric arc and forcibly coated on a rotary iron substrate using compressed air. This thermal process is referred to as double-wire arc thermal spray. The particles generated through these methods fall within the nanometer to micrometer agglomerate size range. There is concern regarding potential human health outcomes as these particles exhibit a similarity in particle morphology to welding fumes. Thermal spray wires with Zn (PMET540), Fe and Cr (PMET731), and Ni (PMET885) as primary metal compositions were used to generate particulate via an electric arc wire thermal spray generator for exposure to human bronchial cells (BEAS-2B) to examine comparative toxicity ranging from 0-200 µg/mL. Resulting cellular viability was assessed through live cell counts, and percent cytotoxicity was measured as a function of LDH release. Oxidative stress, genotoxicity, and alteration in Total Antioxidant Capacity were evaluated through DNA damage (COMET analysis) and antioxidant concentration at 0, 3.125, 25, and 100 µg/mL. Protein markers for Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) were also assessed to determine inflammation and endothelial alteration.","title":"Comparative in vitro toxicity of different thermal spray particulates in human bronchial cells","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/fsf9-trph/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/fuzh-wm4c","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-24","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-02","keyword":["nedss","2019","wonder","salmonellosis (excluding salmonella typhi infection and salmonella paratyphi infection)","salmonella typhi infection","salmonella paratyphi infection","nndss","netss"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/fuzh-wm4c","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1EE.

Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) and both naïve and activated macrophages (THP-1) were treated with 10, 100, and 1000 µM of flavoring chemicals and analyzed for changes in viability, cell membrane damage, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and inflammatory cytokine release. Viability was most greatly affected by decanal, hexanal, nonanal, cinnamaldehyde, eugenol, vanillin, alpha-pinene, eugenol, and limonene. High amounts of ROS were elicited by vanillin, ethyl maltol, and the diketones (2,3-pentanedione, 2,3-heptanedione, and 2,3-hexanedione) from both cell lines. Naïve THP-1 cells produced significant levels of IL-1β, IL-8, and TNF-α when exposed to ethyl maltol and hexanal. Activated THP-1 cells released increased IL-1β and TNF-α when exposed to ethyl maltol, but many flavoring chemicals had an apparent suppressive effect on inflammatory cytokines released by activated macrophages, with varying degrees of accompanying cytotoxicity. The diketones, L-carvone, and linalool, suppressed cytokine release in the absence of cytotoxicity. These findings provide insight into patterns of cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine release potentially relevant to the development of pathological changes in the lungs of e-cigarette users.","title":"Effects of E-Cigarette Flavoring Chemicals on Human Macrophages and Bronchial Epithelial Cells","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/fveu-vvk9/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dfwed/beam-dashboard.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-04-10","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-01-21","keyword":["campylobacteriosis","escherichia","beam","beam dashboard","salmonella"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"SIMSO","hasEmail":"mailto:simso@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"CDC"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/fvm6-ic5r","description":"The BEAM (Bacteria, Enterics, Amoeba, and Mycotics) Dashboard is an interactive tool to access and visualize data from the System for Enteric Disease Response, Investigation, and Coordination (SEDRIC).

More information about the IIS can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/about.html. \n\n• Influenza vaccination coverage estimate numerators include the number of people receiving at least one dose of influenza vaccine in a given flu season, based on information that state, territorial, and local public health agencies report to CDC. Some jurisdictions’ data may include data submitted by tribes. Estimates include persons who are deceased but received a vaccination during the current season. People receiving doses are attributed to the jurisdiction in which the person resides unless noted otherwise. Quality and completeness of data may vary across jurisdictions. Influenza vaccination coverage denominators are obtained from 2020 U.S. Census Bureau population estimates. \n\n• Monthly estimates shown are cumulative, reflecting all persons vaccinated from July through a given month of that flu season. Cumulative estimates include any historical data reported since the previous submission. National estimates are not presented since not all U.S. jurisdictions are currently reporting their IIS data to CDC. Jurisdictions reporting data to CDC include U.S. states, some localities, and territories. \n\n• Because IIS data contain all vaccinations administered within a jurisdiction rather than a sample, standard errors were not calculated and statistical testing for differences in estimates across years were not performed. \n\n• Laws and policies regarding the submission of vaccination data to an IIS vary by state, which may impact the completeness of vaccination coverage reflected for a jurisdiction. More information on laws and policies are found at https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/iis/policy-legislation.html. \n\n• Coverage estimates based on IIS data are expected to differ from National Immunization Survey (NIS) estimates for children (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-coverage-race.html)                 \nand adults (https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-adult-coverage.html) because NIS estimates are based on a sample that may not be representative after survey weighting and vaccination status is determined by survey respondent rather than vaccine records or administrations, and quality and completeness of IIS data may vary across jurisdictions. In general, NIS estimates tend to overestimate coverage due to overreporting and IIS estimates may underestimate coverage due to incompleteness of data in certain jurisdictions.","title":"Monthly Cumulative Number and Percent of Persons Who Receive ≥1 Influenza Vaccination Doses and Comparison Between 2023-2024 and Two Previous Seasons, by Jurisdiction, United States","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/g2ck-geg5/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/g2ck-geg5/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/g2ck-geg5/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/g2ck-geg5/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/g2ck-geg5/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/g2ck-geg5/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/g2ck-geg5/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"Jurisdictions - States, District of Columbia, Islands, and US cities","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"Monthly","theme":["Flu Vaccinations"],"language":["English"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/g3c9-wbme","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2022-01-14","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2022-02-11","keyword":["wonder","nndss","netss","nedss","confirmed","2022","probable","vibriosis"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/g3c9-wbme","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1LL.

Here, we examine the effect of mitigation strategies on reducing the risk of exposure to simulated respiratory aerosol particles within a classroom-style meeting room. To quantify exposure of uninfected individuals (Recip-ients), surrogate respiratory aerosol particles were generated by a breathing simulator with a headform (Source) that mimicked breath exhalations.

County-level provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts (see Technical Notes).\n\nThe provisional data presented on the dashboard below include reported 12 month-ending provisional counts of death due to drug overdose by the decedent’s county of residence and the month in which death occurred.\n\nPercentages of deaths with a cause of death pending further investigation and a note on historical completeness (e.g. if the percent completeness was under 90% after 6 months) are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical Notes). Counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS confidentiality standards. Provisional data presented on this page will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional records are received.\n\nTechnical Notes\n\nNature and Sources of Data\n\nProvisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from the state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).\n\nThe timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death and jurisdiction in which the death occurred. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death due to the time often needed to investigate these deaths (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.\n\nProvisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for “12 month-ending periods,” defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12 month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12 month-ending period in June 2020 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. The 12 month-ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12 month-ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation.\n\nCause of Death Classification and Definition of Drug Deaths\n\nMortality statistics are compiled in accordance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regul","title":"VSRR Provisional County-Level Drug Overdose Death Counts","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"United States","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/gb67-x49c","issued":"2023-10-18","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-10-18","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"SOZ9@cdc.gov","hasEmail":"mailto:no-reply@data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb67-x49c","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"description":"","title":"edav-demo-dataset-api","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb67-x49c/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb67-x49c/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb67-x49c/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb67-x49c/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb67-x49c/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb67-x49c/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb67-x49c/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dph/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-06-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-08-25","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html"],"keyword":["places","outcomes","health","brfss","behaviors","zip code","zcta","status","risk","prevention","prevalence"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"PLACES Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:places@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gd4x-jyhw","description":"This dataset contains model-based ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level estimates for the PLACES 2022 release.

It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015–2019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year.

We tested the hypothesis that changes in cardiovascular function after inhalation of COV are manifested as changes in the responsiveness of the heart and peripheral vascular system to vasoconstricting and vasodilating agonists.

However, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of these Cu species is limiting the future investigation of the toxicity of these materials and their potential health impact on workers. In this work, we used a combination of scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to analyze the particles released during the sanding/sawing of copper-treated lumber. We have demonstrated using EELS Cu L2,3 edges with comparative reference spectra to determine the Cu species. Three types of species, including basic copper carbonate (BCC), Cu(0), and Cu(II)-Wood complex, were identified in released wood dust particles. The unbound copper particles also exist as a form of BCC or reduced Cu(0).

The dataset contains a weekly summary of aggregate counts of the total SARS-CoV-2 tests and SARS-CoV-2 detections reported to NREVSS since March 14, 2020. These data are reported weekly on a voluntary basis. Clinical laboratories do not report demographic data through NREVSS. Testing practices may vary regionally, and the number of participating laboratories may change from year to year. Results can be changed for up to 2 years after the initial reporting week. However, discrepancies may be noted and updated at the discretion of the data stewards and key stakeholders.\n\nWhile NREVSS strives to present the most precise estimates of respiratory viral trends with reporting burden minimized for participating laboratories, there are several inherent limitations to this surveillance system.\n\nNREVSS does not collect patient-specific data or demographic information. Multiple samples may be collected from a single patient, so NREVSS results do not necessarily reflect the number of patients tested, nor do they directly reflect hospitalizations or deaths related to COVID-19.\n\nParticipating laboratories vary in size, testing capabilities, and areas served. Some institutions may receive and test samples from sites across a given state or even from multiple states. Without direct knowledge of the population base, NREVSS cannot be used to determine the prevalence or incidence of infection.\n\nFor more information on NREVSS and COVID-19 surveillance please visit: https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss. These data appear starting May 25, 2023 on the CDC COVID Data Tracker at the following URLs: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends ; https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#cases.   \n\nNREVSS data are reported at the national and HHS regional levels. The ten (10) U.S. Department of HHS regions are defined here: https://www.hhs.gov/about/agencies/iea/regional-offices/index.html. \n\nThe data represent SARS-CoV-2 Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) results, which include reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests from a voluntary, sentinel network of participating laboratories in the United States, including clinical, public health and commercial laboratories (https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/labs/index.html). \n\nThese data exclude antigen, antibody, and at-home test results. \n\nAll data are provisional and subject to change. Reporting is less complete for the past 1 week, and more complete (>90%) for the period 2 weeks earlier. \n\nThere are data from all states across the 10 HHS regions. Because the data are from a sentinel network of laboratories, however, results may vary geographically. The data do not include all test results within a jurisdiction and therefore do not reflect all SARS-CoV-2 NAATs administered in the United States. \n\nPercent positivity is one of the surveillance metrics used to monitor COVID-19 transmission over time and by area. Percent positivity is calculated by dividing the number of positive NAATs by the total number of NAATs administered, then multiplying by 100 [(# of positive NAAT tests / total NAAT tests) x 100].\n\nThe data represent laboratory tests performed, not individual (deduplicated) results in people. In the table and upon hovering on the map, the total test counts in the data reflect the latest data reported from NREVSS laboratories and may not match the data presented by various jurisdictions.\n\nOn May 11, 2023, CDC discontinued utilizing the COVID electronic laboratory reporting (CELR) platform as the primary laboratory source of COVID-19 results. These data are archived at health.data.gov.\n\nFor more information about NREVSS, please see: https://www.cdc.gov/surveillance/nrevss/","title":"Percent Positivity of COVID-19 Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests by HHS Region, National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gvsb-yw6g/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gvsb-yw6g/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gvsb-yw6g/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gvsb-yw6g/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gvsb-yw6g/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gvsb-yw6g/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gvsb-yw6g/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"US","accrualPeriodicity":"Weekly","theme":["Laboratory Surveillance"],"language":["English"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/gxj9-t96f","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-11-17","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"2020-12-13/2022-08-10","modified":"2022-10-20","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/distributing/about-vaccine-data.html"],"keyword":["izdl","immunization","covid-19","report date","coronavirus","administration","vaccination","cases"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"NCIRD","hasEmail":"mailto:iisinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"CDC"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gxj9-t96f","description":"</p><p style=\"margin:0in;vertical-align:baseline;\"><strong><em><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;color:black;'>After October 13, 2022, this dataset will no longer be updated as the related CDC COVID Data Tracker site was retired on October 13, 2022.</span></em></strong><span style='font-size:15px;font-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif;color:black;'>&nbsp;</span></p>This dataset contains historical trends in vaccinations and cases by age group, at the US national level.

Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status.

Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2021 or 2020 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey 2017–2021, or 2016–2020 estimates.

The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\n\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself.

The response to this disaster involved the efforts of tens of thousands of workers in a variety of capacities across Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, and in the Gulf of Mexico itself. The diverse work included oil and tar ball removal from beaches, oil skimming and booming near shores, burning of surface oil near the source of the oil release, surface application of dispersant by vessels and aircraft, and containment and recovery work on vessels at the release site. The nature of these activities raised concerns about potential occupational exposures to chemical and physical hazards and mental stressors.\n\nNIOSH investigators conducted health hazard evaluations (HHEs) of Deepwater Horizon Response onshore and offshore workers. The goals of the NIOSH HHE assessments were to describe acute health effects, evaluate occupational exposures in qualitative or quantitative assessments, and generate hypotheses regarding symptoms potentially related to work activities. Environmental air samples were collected in support of the goals.\n\nNIOSH investigators conducted the following exposure evaluations:\n\n- We conducted evaluations on board vessels releasing dispersant. These vessels were deployed to perform small‐scale releases of dispersant in an area with surface oil contamination.\n- We assessed exposures during in‐situ (i.e., on site) burns of surface oil.\n- We assessed exposures on fishing and shrimping trawlers in the Vessels of Opportunity (VoO) program that were assigned to remove surface oil by booming and skimming.\n- We assessed exposures aboard vessels located at the Deepwater Horizon incident site.\n- We assessed exposures during boom and vessel decontamination operations.","title":"Deepwater Horizon Response Air Sampling Data","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/ha59-j5yk/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/haed-k2ka","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2016-09-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2016-09-26","keyword":["cdc","centers for disease control and prevention"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/haed-k2ka","description":"Alcohol-Impaired Driving Fatalities 2005-2014; All persons killed in crashes involving a driver with BAC >= .08 g/dL.

Elucidating how ENM-induced inflammation is resolved is necessary for better evaluation of the fibrogenic and tumorigenic potentials of ENMs. This study aimed to identify pro-resolving mechanisms by analyzing the inflammatory and fibrogenic responses to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs, Mitsui-7) and fullerenes (fullerene C60, C60F) in B6C3F1 mice. The findings reveal that MWCNTs at a low dose (40 µg/mouse) and C60F at a high dose (>480 mg/mouse) stimulated acute neutrophilic inflammation, which exhibited rapid initiation and extended resolution. The lesion in MWCNT-exposed mice progressed to fibrotic granulomas by day 28 post-exposure, whereas it remained as alveolar histiocytosis in C60F-exposed mice.

As such, the current investigation examines the combined effect of physical distancing, universal masking, and ventilation on exposure to airborne particles generated during breathing and coughing within a controlled indoor environment.

SARS-CoV-2 infection results in an acute, severe respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).  The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to a global public health crisis, which continues to affect populations across the globe. Real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) is the reference standard test for COVID-19 diagnosis. Serological tests are valuable tools for serosurveillance programs and establishing correlates of protection from disease. This study evaluated the performance of one in-house enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) utilizing the pre-fusion stabilized ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S), two commercially available chemiluminescence assays Ortho VITROS Immunodiagnostic Products Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Total Reagent Pack and Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay and one commercially available Surrogate Virus Neutralization Test (sVNT), GenScript USA Inc., cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies.  Using a panel of rRT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients’ sera and a negative control group as a reference standard, all three immunoassays demonstrated high comparable positivity rates and low discordant rates.  All three immunoassays were highly sensitive with estimated sensitivities ranging from 95.4%-96.6%. ROC curve analysis indicated that all three immunoassays had high diagnostic accuracies with area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.9698-0.9807. High positive correlation was demonstrated among the conventional microneutralization test (MNT) titers and the sVNT inhibition percent values.  Our study indicates that independent evaluations are necessary to optimize the overall utility and the interpretation of the results of serological tests.  Overall, we demonstrate that all serological tests evaluated in this study are suitable for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.","title":"Examination of SARS-CoV-2 serological test results from multiple commercial and laboratory platforms with an in-house serum panel","programCode":["009:026"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hhvg-83jq/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hhvg-83jq/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hhvg-83jq/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hhvg-83jq/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hhvg-83jq/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hhvg-83jq/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hhvg-83jq/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/statesystem/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-07-18","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-04-01","keyword":["tobacco","preemption","policy","osh","legislation","state system"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/hj2x-85ya","description":"1995-2025.

The underground coal mines in Colorado’s North Fork Valley (NFV) have experienced many coal bursts, often with distinct characteristics from those of other US coal mining regions. To better understand these events and manage their associated risks, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health undertook a long-term monitoring campaign at the Elk Creek Mine in the NFV. The monitoring efforts included a seismic network composed of both surface and underground sensors, borehole pressure cells (BPCs), instrumented support Cans, convergence monitors, ground condition surveys, and several other data sources. This dataset consists of the event waveform files from the seismic network for the 983,379 events that were detected during the monitoring campaign.

The data are updated week-by-week as new RSV-associated hospitalizations are reported to CDC from the RSV-NET surveillance system and include both new admissions that occurred during the reporting week, as well as those admitted in previous weeks that may not have been included in earlier reporting. Each week CDC estimates a range (i.e., lower estimate and an upper estimate) of RSV-associated hospitalizations that have occurred since October 1, 2024. For details, please refer to the publication [7].  \n\n<b>Note:</b> Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent RSV-associated hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays; as new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly.\n\n<b>Note:</b> Preliminary burden estimates are not inclusive of data from all RSV-NET sites. Due to model limitations, sites with small sample sizes can impact estimates in unpredictable ways and are excluded for the benefit of model stability. CDC is working to address model limitations and include data from all sites in final burden estimates.\n\n<b>References</b>\n<ol><li>Reed C, Chaves SS, Daily Kirley P, et al.

Occupational exposure to HTV can also induce a hypersensitivity of the sympathetic nervous system to various stimuli, which in turn can result in vasoconstriction of the peripheral blood vessels and blanching of the skin because of reductions in peripheral blood flow. The data presented were collected using an established animal model of vibration-induced white finger (Welcome et al. 2008) to determine if changes in blood flow induced by vibration exposure could be used as a biomarker for the development of vibration-induced peripheral vascular disease. Two separate experiments were done. In Experiment 1, changes in blood flow were measured in the ventral tail artery of the rat tail before and after a 4 h exposure to tail vibration (frequency 125 Hz, amplitude 5 g).

Polarization of the macrophages regulates the production of proinflammatory and pro-resolving lipid mediators (LMs) to mediate acute inflammation and its resolution in a time-dependent manner. Here we examined the molecular mechanism by which multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs, Mitsui-7) induce M1 polarization in vitro. Treatment of murine macrophages (J774A.1) with Mitsui-7 MWCNTs increased the expression of Alox5 mRNA and protein in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. The MWCNTs induced the expression of CD68, and that induction persisted for up to 3 days post-exposure. The expression and activity of inducible nitric oxide synthase, an intracellular marker of M1, were increased by MWCNTs. Consistent with M1 polarization, the MWCNTs induced the production and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, and proinflammatory LMs leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). The cell-free media from MWCNT-polarized macrophages induced the migration of neutrophilic cells (differentiated from HL-60), which was blocked by Acebilustat, a specific leukotriene A4 hydrolase inhibitor, or LY239111, an LTB4 receptor antagonist, but not NS-398, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, revealing LTB4 as a major mediator of neutrophil chemotaxis from MWCNT-polarized macrophages. Knockdown of Alox5 using specific small hairpin-RNA suppressed MWCNT-induced M1 polarization, LTB4 secretion, and migration of neutrophils. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the polarization of M1 macrophages by Mitsui-7 MWCNTs in vitro and that induction of Alox5 is an important mechanism by which the MWCNTs promote proinflammatory responses by boosting M1 polarization and production of proinflammatory LMs.","title":"Multi-Walled Carbon Nanotubes Induce Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase Expression and Enhance the Polarization and Function of M1 Macrophages in vitro","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/iudi-d4pc/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2017-04-12","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-04-28","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/"],"keyword":["system","brfss","factor","questions","risk","surveillance","survey","behavioral"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DPH Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:PublicInquiriesDPH@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/iuq5-y9ct","description":"1984-2023.

The underground coal mines in Colorado’s North Fork Valley (NFV) have experienced many coal bursts, often with distinct characteristics from those of other US coal mining regions. To better understand these events and manage their associated risks, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health undertook a long-term monitoring campaign at the Elk Creek Mine in the NFV. The monitoring efforts included a seismic network composed of both surface and underground sensors, borehole pressure cells (BPCs), instrumented support Cans, convergence monitors, ground condition surveys, and several other data sources. This dataset consists of the event waveform files from the seismic network for the 983,379 events that were detected during the monitoring campaign. The waveforms are stored in HDF5 files that are broken up by week. Within the HDF5 files, the data are organized by station id, event time, and channel.

For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making. \n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00). \n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substantial (8.00-9.99); and High (greater than or equal to 10.00). \n\n\nThe data in this dataset are considered provisional by CDC and are subject to change until the data are reconciled and verified with the state and territorial data providers. \n\nThis dataset is created using <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/maso/policy/policy385.pdf\">CDC’s Policy on Public Health Research and Nonresearch Data Management and Access</a>.\n\n\n<b>Archived data </b>\nCDC has archived two prior versions of these datasets.

Diesel particulate and fumes are a major contributor to air pollution. Workers in a number of different occupations, including mining, oil and gas exploration and refining, and drivers of heavy equipment who are regularly exposed to diesel exhaust while on the job, and persons living in areas with high levels of air pollution, are at an increased risk for developing asthma, cardiovascular disease and certain cancers.\n\nUnderstanding the physiological and cellular effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on Various organs in the body is critical for identifying exposure-induced biological and physiological markers of disease or dysfunction. The experiments in this manuscript, focus on the effects of diesel exhaust (DE) inhalation on peripheral and cardiovascular function. In the current studies, we hypothesized that the development of cardiovascular disease in workers regularly exposed to DE is the result of the inhalation of volatile gases and particulate within the vapor that affect the cardiovascular system by altering physiological and cellular processes that affect peripheral vascular responsiveness to agents that cause blood vessels to constrict and vessels that cause blood vessels to dilate, blood pressure, cardiac output and kidney function (kidney function as it may contribute to changes in blood pressure). We also predicted that these changes in physiology would be associated with changes in the expression of proteins and the production of genes that play a role in regulating oxidative stress, responses to decreases in oxygen, and markers of kidney function that are associated with blood pressure.","title":"The effects of diesel exhaust inhalation on cardiovascular function","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/jgkt-w9bh/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease-and-stroke-data/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2022-11-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-02-11","keyword":["heart disease","heart","county","cardiovascular disease","counties","cardiovascular"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DHDSP Requests","hasEmail":"mailto:dhdsprequests@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/jiwm-ppbh","description":"2018 to 2020, 3-year average.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nEstimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as “Unreliable” in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999–2015. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).","title":"NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by State: United States","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/jx6g-fdh6/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/jx6g-fdh6/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/jx6g-fdh6/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/jx6g-fdh6/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/jx6g-fdh6/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/jx6g-fdh6/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/jx6g-fdh6/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"United States","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/jxu8-x79m","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2024-04-24","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-01-16","keyword":["disparities","brfss","dashboard","cigarette smoking","tobacco"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/jxu8-x79m","description":"2011–2023.

Considering the projected increase in the production and use of nanomaterials, a corresponding increase in occupational exposure to nanomaterials and their resulting adverse health effects may be anticipated among workers. There is substantial evidence in the literature, based on cell culture and animal studies, supporting the potential toxicity and detrimental health effects associated with exposure to nanomaterials. Intervention and/or prevention of adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to toxic nanomaterials is a concern for health providers and regulatory and non-regulatory government agencies as the use of nanomaterials expand. A key element in the intervention and/or prevention of the adverse health effects associated with occupational exposure to toxic nanomaterials is a clear understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the pulmonary toxicity induced by nanomaterials.\n\nDue to its physicochemical and mechanical properties, multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) have found many industrial applications. There is potential for human exposure to MWCNT or products that contain MWCNT both during the production and use of the materials that contain MWCNT. The objectives of the current study were to investigate MWCNT-induced lung toxicity and the molecular mechanisms underlying that toxicity. A rat inhalation exposure model was employed to determine the lung toxicity induced by MWCNT.

Diesel engines are common on gas extraction and oil sites, leading to complex DE exposure to a broad range of compounds through occupational settings.  The US EPA concluded that short-term exposure to DE leads to allergic inflammatory disorders of the airways.  To further evaluate the immunotoxicity of DE, the effects of whole-body inhalation of 0.2 and 1 mg/m3 DE (total carbon; 6 h/d for 4 days) were investigated 1-, 7-, and 27-days post exposure in Sprague-Dawley rats using an occupationally relevant exposure system.  DE exposure of 1 mg/m3 increased total cellularity, number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, and B-cells at 1 d post-exposure in the lung lymph nodes.  At 7 d post-exposure to 1 mg/m3, cellularity and the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells decreased in the LLNs.  In the bronchoalveolar lavage, B-cell number and frequency increased at 1 d post-exposure, Natural Killer cell number and frequency decreased at 7 d post-exposure, and at 27 d post-exposure CD8+ T-cell and CD11b+ cell number and frequency decreased with 0.2 mg/m3 exposure.  In the spleen, 0.2 mg/m3 increased CD4+ T-cell frequency at 1 and 7 d post-exposure and at 27 d post-exposure increased CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell number and CD8+ T-cell frequency.  B-cells were the only immune cell subset altered in the three tissues (spleen, LLNs, and BALF), suggesting the induction of the adaptive immune response.  The increase in lymphocytes in several different organ types also suggests an induction of a systemic inflammatory response occurring following DE exposure.  These results show that DE exposure induced modifications of cellularity of phenotypic subsets that may impair immune function and contribute to airway inflammation induced by DE exposure in rats.","title":"Effects of inhaled tier-2 diesel engine exhaust on immunotoxicity in a rat model:  A hazard identification study.

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. Project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2019 or 2018 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2015 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the county level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. https://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=024cf3f6f59e49fe8c70e0e5410fe3cf","title":"PLACES: County Data (GIS Friendly Format), 2021 release","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmvs-jkvx/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmvs-jkvx/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmvs-jkvx/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmvs-jkvx/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmvs-jkvx/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmvs-jkvx/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmvs-jkvx/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"theme":["500 Cities & Places"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/kmxt-xb3i","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-11-16","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"Most recent month","modified":"2025-09-15","keyword":["deaths","covid-19","coronavirus","ncird-corvd","mortality","demographics"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC-INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"CORVD"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmxt-xb3i","description":"Count and percent of total COVID-19 deaths since January 1, 2020, by age group, race/ethnicity, and sex","title":"Total COVID-19 Deaths since January 1, 2020 by Age Group, Race/Ethnicity, and Sex","programCode":["009:026"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmxt-xb3i/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmxt-xb3i/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmxt-xb3i/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmxt-xb3i/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmxt-xb3i/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmxt-xb3i/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kmxt-xb3i/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"United States","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["Public Health Surveillance"]},{"accessLevel":"restricted public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"rights":"This dataset is restricted to authorized researchers due to indirect identifying sensitive information.  Researchers must apply for data access through a proposal process, take confidentiality and sign a data use agreement.  If approved, data access would occur at a NCHS or Federal Statistical Research Data Center.  For more information about submitting a proposal for data access, please see: https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/leftbrch/presubmit.htm","issued":"2022-05-31","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"1950-2020","modified":"2025-04-21","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/deaths.htm"],"keyword":["deaths","research-data-center","mortality","injury"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kn6j-fsdu","description":"Data are based on information from all death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015–2019 estimates.

Recruitment of immune cells to the lung microenvironment via secreted chemokines by alveolar macrophages may play a role during asthma pathogenesis. Our prior study identified that alternatively activated (M2) macrophage-associated markers and chemokines were induced by MDI/MDI-Glutathione (GSH)-mediated Krüppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4) upregulation in macrophages and induced chemotaxis abilities to naïve T-cells and eosinophils; however, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI upregulated KLF4 expression is unclear. Previously, we identified that two microRNAs (miRs) including hsa-miR-206-3p and hsa-miR-381-3p were significantly downregulated in MDI-GSH-exposed THP-1 macrophages. In silico analysis revealed that one hsa-miR-206-3p and two hsa-miR-381-3p predicted binding sites exist on the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of KLF4 transcripts. We hypothesize that MDI/MDI-GSH exposure induces M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines through hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p mediated KLF4 upregulation in macrophages. The first aim of this study was to examine whether hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p regulates KLF4 expression in THP-1 macrophages through a posttranscriptional regulation mechanism. Our second aim was to determine whether hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p participates in KLF4-regulated M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines after MDI-exposure. After identifying the role of endogenous hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p in regulation of KLF4 transcription factor after MDI-exposure, we investigated the role of hsa-miR-206-3p/hsa-miR-381-3p in regulation of M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokines’ expressions in relation to the exposure to MDI.","title":"MicroRNA-Mediated Krüppel-Like Factor 4 upregulation Induces Alternatively Activated Macrophage-Associated Markers and Chemokines Transcription in 4,4’-Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate Exposed Macrophages","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/kuas-t2xn/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dph/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2018-10-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-08-25","references":["https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/179/8/1025/109078","https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/182/2/127/93984","https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2017/17_0281.htm","https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2018/18_0313.htm"],"keyword":["behaviors","500cities","census","cities","gis","outcomes","prevalence","prevention","tract","unhealthy"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"500 Cities Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:places@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/kucs-wizg","description":"2015, 2014.

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 29 measures at the census tract level. An ArcGIS Online feature service is also available for users to make maps online or to add data to desktop GIS software. \nhttps://cdcarcgis.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=024cf3f6f59e49fe8c70e0e5410fe3cf","title":"PLACES: Census Tract Data (GIS Friendly Format), 2021 release","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mb5y-ytti/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mb5y-ytti/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mb5y-ytti/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mb5y-ytti/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mb5y-ytti/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mb5y-ytti/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mb5y-ytti/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"describedBy":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/dataset/PLACES-Census-Tract-Data-GIS-Friendly-Format-2020-/yjkw-uj5s","theme":["500 Cities & Places"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/mbd7-r32t","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2020-05-17","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"2020-01-01/2024-06-21","modified":"2025-02-23","references":["https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mbd7-r32t/files/53195382-2916-4a7a-b97f-010111f3aaa1?download=true&filename=public%2033%20utility%20summary.pdf"],"keyword":["covid-19","covid19","covid","coronavirus","cases","ncird-corvd","surveillance","restricted"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC-INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"CDC"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mbd7-r32t","description":"<b>Note:</b>\nReporting of new COVID-19 Case Surveillance data will be discontinued July 1, 2024, to align with the process of removing SARS-CoV-2 infections (COVID-19 cases) from the list of nationally notifiable diseases.

The underground coal mines in Colorado’s North Fork Valley (NFV) have experienced many coal bursts, often with distinct characteristics from those of other US coal mining regions. To better understand these events and manage their associated risks, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health undertook a long-term monitoring campaign at the Elk Creek Mine in the NFV. The monitoring efforts included a seismic network composed of both surface and underground sensors, borehole pressure cells (BPCs), instrumented support Cans, convergence monitors, ground condition surveys, and several other data sources. This dataset consists of the event waveform files from the seismic network for the 983,379 events that were detected during the monitoring campaign. The waveforms are stored in HDF5 files that are broken up by week. Within the HDF5 files, the data are organized by station id, event time, and channel. The amplitudes are velocity in meters/second.\n \nThis is download 20 of 48 and corresponds to the time range between May 16, 2011, and July 4, 2011.","title":"Elk Creek Seismic Waveforms 2011 (Part 12 of 19)","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/mg59-88ii/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:20"],"landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/mhj9-4wi2","issued":"2016-11-30","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-02-05","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mhj9-4wi2","description":"2010-2018; 2019.

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).","title":"NNDSS - TABLE 1BB.

These costs cross numerous boundaries, and generally address the overall costs to victims and the affected groups, and to society as a whole. This represents a cause for concern to employers, worker groups, policy makers, medical personnel, economists and others interested in workplace safety and health. This broad-reaching burden can include social costs, organizational costs, familial and interpersonal group costs, as well as personal costs such as suffering and loss of companionship. The data in the accompanying tables focus on monetary costs of fatal occupational injury which largely consist of foregone wages, but also include the direct costs of medical care and the indirect costs of household production and certain ancillary measures.\n\nThese data represent a continuation of prior research by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) that attempted to delimit the economic consequences of workplace injury for earlier years. Interested parties should be aware that these data serve as a supplemental update to prior NIOSH publications which described the magnitude and circumstances of occupational injury deaths for earlier years 1,2.\n\nThe current data build on this research, and the findings are compelling. Over the period studied, 2003-2010, the costs from these 42,380 premature deaths exceeded $44 billion, an amount greater than the reportable gross domestic product for some States. These findings inform the national will to reduce this severe toll on our nation’s workers, institutions, communities, and the nation itself. Researchers and concerned parties within the occupational and public health professions, academia, organizations focusing on workplace safety, labor unions and the business community have all proven to be willing and avid users of this data, and have used this research to continue their efforts, in concert with continuing NIOSH research efforts, to reduce the great toll that injury imposes on our workers, workplaces, and Nation.","title":"Economic Burden of Occupational Fatal Injuries in the United States Based on the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, 2003-2010","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/mkyn-icix/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/mmi4-8ajr","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2013-06-19","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2015-08-27","keyword":["pregnant women","flu shot","immunization","prams"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mmi4-8ajr","description":"For more information about the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System please visit http://www.cdc.gov/prams/.

The underground coal mines in Colorado’s North Fork Valley (NFV) have experienced many coal bursts, often with distinct characteristics from those of other US coal mining regions. To better understand these events and manage their associated risks, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health undertook a long-term monitoring campaign at the Elk Creek Mine in the NFV. The monitoring efforts included a seismic network composed of both surface and underground sensors, borehole pressure cells (BPCs), instrumented support Cans, convergence monitors, ground condition surveys, and several other data sources. This dataset consists of the event waveform files from the seismic network for the 983,379 events that were detected during the monitoring campaign.

Annualization rates presents deaths per year per 100,000 population that would be expected in a year if the observed period specific (weekly/monthly) rate prevailed for a full year.\n\nSub-national death counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS data confidentiality standards. Rates based on death counts less than 20 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS standards of reliability as specified in NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions (available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_175.pdf.).","title":"Provisional COVID-19 death counts, rates, and percent of total deaths, by jurisdiction of residence","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mpx5-t7tu/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mpx5-t7tu/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mpx5-t7tu/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mpx5-t7tu/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mpx5-t7tu/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mpx5-t7tu/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mpx5-t7tu/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"United States, Puerto Rico","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"R/P1W","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/covid-19-mortality-data-files.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-05-12","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"2015-01-04/2021-07-03","modified":"2025-04-21","keyword":["hospital referral region","nchs","provisional","sdoh-access-to-health-care","united states","weekly","all causes","coronavirus","covid-19","deaths","mortality","nvss"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mqmc-4b9n","description":"Provisional count of deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States by week of death and by hospital referral region (HRR).

The performance of Type I industrial helmets for fall protection is not required to be tested in standardized tests. Chin straps and suspension system adjustment mechanisms are two important components of a typical industrial helmet, but the effects of proper use of them on the protective performance of Type I helmets have not been evaluated. The current study was designed to analyze the fall protection performance of Type I industrial helmets and to evaluate if the use of a chin strap and the suspension system tightness have any effect on protection performance. Head impact tests were performed by letting an instrumented manikin free fall backwards, from a standing posture, so that the manikin would make head-first contact with a solid surface of two different materials (concrete and plywood-covered). The results showed that all four tested helmet models demonstrated excellent performances for fall protection compared to the control group without wearing helmets. The fall protection performance of the advanced helmet models was substantially better than the basic helmet models. However, the effects of the use of chin straps and suspension system tightness on the helmets’ fall protection performance were statistically not significant. The findings of our study provide information to help construction companies and manufacturers better manage the use of Type I helmets for fall protection, thereby reducing work-related traumatic brain injury risks.","title":"Evaluation of the fall protection of Type I industrial helmets","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/mscq-ew9n/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/msjj-a7q2","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2016-09-14","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2016-09-14","keyword":["centers for disease control and prevention","cdc"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/msjj-a7q2","description":"Source for 2012 national data: National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS), 2012.

The monitoring efforts included a seismic network composed of both surface and underground sensors, borehole pressure cells (BPCs), instrumented support Cans, convergence monitors, ground condition surveys, and several other data sources. This dataset consists of the event waveform files from the seismic network for the 983,379 events that were detected during the monitoring campaign.

Because symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals with COVID-19 can exhibit a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in their respiratory fluids, the CDC recommends that people wear a face mask that covers the nose and mouth to reduce community transmission during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wearing a face mask to protect others from potentially infectious droplets, called source control, has been shown to be a highly effective infection control strategy to limit the spread of COVID-19.  The presence of mask face seal leaks enables respiratory aerosols to escape out rather than pass through the filtering materials of the mask, consequently reducing the benefits of wearing a face mask for source control.  As such, the current investigation examines various modifications that improve the fit of a medical or cloth face mask and reduce the amounts of expelled aerosols during simulated coughs and exhalations.","title":"Face mask fit modifications that improve source control performance dataset","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/n7uz-829a/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/n835-hpyp","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2017-01-05","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2017-01-05","keyword":["nndss","netss","nedss","mmwr","coccidioidomycosis","chlamydia trachomatis infection","2016","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/n835-hpyp","description":"NNDSS - Table II.

NIOSH recommends using CSTDs to limit occupational exposure to hazardous materials and sharps when compounding and administering these drugs (NIOSH 2004). One of the engineering challenges associated with CSTDs is management of the headspace that is either compressed or displaced when transferring liquids in and out of drug vials. CSTD designs and components employing various technologies include creating a physical barrier to contain the displaced volume of air or filters to clean the displaced volume of air when transferring HD solutions. In 2015, NIOSH developed a protocol to test material containment of barrier type CSTDs (NIOSH 2015). NIOSH presented a plan to update the testing protocol so that it was applicable to both barrier and air cleaning types of CSTDs (NIOSH 2016). Both barrier type CSTDs and air cleaning type CSTDs may be susceptible to either liquid or headspace vapor leaks. Air-cleaning type CSTDs allow free passage of air but are expected to remove semi-volatile hazardous drugs (HD)s from the exiting airstream. Barrier type CSTDs have been designed to contain air rather than clean it, and it is reasonable to conclude that a headspace leak with a barrier type CSTD would contain the drug at the same concentration as the headspace inside the vial. As a result, the procedure described in this paper can adequately assess the efficacy of barrier type CSTDs based on the volume of liquid and headspace vapor leak measured. However, the volatile compounds used in this procedure will readily pass through an air-cleaning CSTD, regardless of the ability to retain a semi-volatile HD. Therefore, testing the efficacy of an air-cleaning CSTD requires coupling the procedure described herein with an assessment of the ability of air cleaning CSTDs to retain an appropriate semi-volatile surrogate when volumes of headspace containing that surrogate are passed through the CSTDs. The difference in the amount of HD contained in liquid versus headspace vapor leaks may be several orders of magnitude. The work presented herein is a test method that can distinguish the origin and volumetric quantity of liquid and headspace vapor leaked.\n\nCSTD evaluation involves operation of CSTDs during normal use tasks, such as transferring a solution between two drug vials (NIOSH 2015). A test solution containing two volatile organic compounds (VOCs), acetone and methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE), was used in the evaluation. Leaks were measured by detecting the VOCs in a glove chamber using Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS) as the detector. Liquid and headspace leaks are differentiated by the ratios of the two VOCs measured as a result of leaks from the CSTD. The compounds, acetone and MTBE, at equal concentrations in a test solution have a concentration ratio in the headspace vapor of the test solution that is very different, as predicted by their Henry’s constants. The ratio of acetone to MTBE detected in the glove chamber can be used to elucidate the source, liquid or headspace, and the magnitude of a leak. The analytical strategy is similar to stable isotope mixing models used to determine contributions from various sources by measuring isotopic ratios (Phillips and Gregg 2001). Propylene glycol (PG) was included in the testing solution as a surrogate for a HD component, though it was not quantified. Fluorescein was included as a visual qualitative indicator of a liquid leak location. SIFT-MS offers low limits of detection and real-time response. The real-time response has the benefit of enabling leaks to be temporally correlated with tasks involving manipulation of CSTD components.","title":"Source Apportionment and Quantification of Liquid and Headspace Leaks from Closed System Transfer Devices via Selected Ion Flow Tube Mass Spectrometry (SIFT-MS)","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/ndit-r2zk/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dph/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-09-29","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-08-25","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html"],"keyword":["place","behaviors","city","gis","unhealthy","prevention","prevalence","places","outcomes"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"PLACES Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:places@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ndzg-9nmv","description":"This dataset contains model-based place (incorporated and census designated places) level estimates for the PLACES project 2020 release in GIS-friendly format.

Although these data will continue to be publicly available, this dataset will no longer be updated.\n\nThe surveillance case definition for COVID-19, a nationally notifiable disease, was first described in a <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-2021/\">position statement</a> from the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists, which was later <a href=\"https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/case-definitions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/\">revised</a>. However, there is some variation in how jurisdictions implemented these case definitions. More information on how CDC collects COVID-19 case surveillance data can be found at <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/faq-surveillance.html\">FAQ: COVID-19 Data and Surveillance</a>.\n\n<b>Aggregate Data Collection Process</b>\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, data were reported from state and local health departments through a robust process with the following steps:\n<ul><li>Aggregate county-level counts were obtained indirectly, via automated overnight web collection, or directly, via a data submission process.</li><li>If more than one official county data source existed, CDC used a comprehensive data selection process comparing each official county data source to retrieve the highest case and death counts, unless otherwise specified by the state.</li><li>A CDC data team reviewed counts for congruency prior to integration and set up alerts to monitor for discrepancies in the data.</li><li>CDC routinely compiled these data and post the finalized information on COVID Data Tracker.</li><li>County level data were aggregated to obtain state- and territory- specific totals.</li><li>Counting of cases and deaths is based on date of report and not on the date of symptom onset. CDC calculates rates in these data by using population estimates provided by the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program (2019 Vintage).</li><li>COVID-19 aggregate case and death data are organized in a time series that includes cumulative number of cases and deaths as reported by a jurisdiction on a given date.  New case and death counts are calculated as the week-to-week change in cumulative counts of cases and deaths reported (i.e., newly reported cases and deaths = cumulative number of cases/deaths reported this week minus the cumulative total reported the prior week.</li></ul>\n\nThis process was collaborative, with CDC and jurisdictions working together to ensure the accuracy of COVID-19 case and death numbers. County counts provided the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date. Throughout data collection, CDC retrospectively updated counts to correct known data quality issues.\n\n<b>Description</b>\nThis archived public use dataset focuses on the cumulative and weekly case and death rates per 100,000 persons within various sociodemographic factors across all states and their counties. All resulting data are expressed as rates calculated as the number of cases or deaths per 100,000 persons in counties meeting various classification criteria using <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/popest/2010s-counties-total.html\">the US Census Bureau Population Estimates Program</a> (2019 Vintage).\n\nEach county within jurisdictions is classified into multiple categories for each factor. All rates in this dataset are based on classification of counties by the characteristics of their population, not individual-level factors.  This applies to each of the available factors observed in this dataset. Specific factors and their corresponding categories are detailed below.\n\n<b>Population-level factors</b>\nEach unique population factor is detailed below.

Similar to this dataset, the <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-T/nra9-vzzn\">original dataset</a> with daily data as posted is archived on 10/20/2022.

A new dataset containing community transmission data by county as originally posted is now published weekly and can be found at: <a href=\"https://data.cdc.gov/dataset/Weekly-COVID-19-County-Level-of-Community-Transmis/dt66-w6m6\">Weekly COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission as Originally Posted | Data | Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (cdc.gov)</a>.\n\nThis public use dataset has 7 data elements reflecting historical data for community transmission levels for all available counties and jurisdictions. It contains historical data for the county level of community transmission and includes updated data submitted by states and jurisdictions. Each day, the dataset was updated to include the most recent days’ data and incorporate any historical changes made by jurisdictions. This dataset includes data since January 22, 2020. Transmission level is set to low, moderate, substantial, or high using the calculation rules below.\n\n<b>Methods for calculating county level of community transmission indicator</b>\nThe County Level of Community Transmission indicator uses two metrics: (1) total new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 persons in the last 7 days and (2) percentage of positive SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in the last 7 days. For each of these metrics, CDC classifies transmission values as low, moderate, substantial, or high (below and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7030e2.htm?s_cid=mm7030e2_w#T1_down\">here</a>). If the values for each of these two metrics differ (e.g., one indicates moderate and the other low), then the higher of the two should be used for decision-making.\n\n<b>CDC core metrics of and thresholds for community transmission levels of SARS-CoV-2</b>\n\n<b>Total New Case Rate Metric:</b> \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is calculated by adding the number of new cases in the county (or other administrative level) in the last 7 days divided by the population in the county (or other administrative level) and multiplying by 100,000. \"New cases per 100,000 persons in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (0-9.99); Moderate (10.00-49.99); Substantial (50.00-99.99); and High (greater than or equal to 100.00).\n\n<b>Test Percent Positivity Metric:</b> \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is calculated by dividing the number of positive tests in the county (or other administrative level) during the last 7 days by the total number of tests resulted over the last 7 days. \"Percentage of positive NAAT in the past 7 days\" is considered to have transmission level of Low (less than 5.00); Moderate (5.00-7.99); Substa","title":"United States COVID-19 County Level of Community Transmission Historical Changes - ARCHIVED","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nra9-vzzn/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nra9-vzzn/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nra9-vzzn/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nra9-vzzn/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nra9-vzzn/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nra9-vzzn/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nra9-vzzn/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"US","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"No longer updated (dataset archived)","theme":["Public Health Surveillance"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/dashboard/vaccination-coverage-race.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-11-29","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"2023-2024","modified":"2024-04-12","keyword":["nis-ccm","flu vaccination"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"VaxView Team","hasEmail":"mailto:vaxview@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nsxk-tvbw","description":"• Influenza vaccination coverage and parental intent among children 6 months to 17 years is assessed through the National Immunization Survey-Child COVID Module providing weekly COVID-19 vaccination coverage estimates.

Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2). \r\n\r\nData are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nCauses of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2020 or 2019 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey 2015–2019 estimates. The 2022 release uses 2020 BRFSS data for 25 measures and 2019 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening) that the survey collects data on every other year.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nEstimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as “Unreliable” in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999–2015. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).","title":"NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by County: United States","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"United States","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/rsv/php/surveillance/rsv-net.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2024-07-23","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-09-19","keyword":["respiratory syncytial virus","respiratory virus response","surveillance","rsv-net","rsvnet","rsv","rates by age group","respiratory disease","respiratory illness","age-adjusted rates by race and ethnicity","hospitalization rate","hospitalizations","rate","rates by race and ethnicity","age-adjusted rates"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"RESP-NET","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"CDC"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbq2-7wr2","description":"The Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET) is a network that conducts active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed RSV-associated hospitalizations in children younger than 18 years of age and adults.

The present study evaluated the systemic and immunotoxicity of sub-chronic 28- or 10-day dermal exposure of PFHxS (0.625-5% or 15.63-125 mg/kg/dose) in a murine model.  Elevated levels of PFHxS were detected in the serum and urine, suggesting that absorption is occurring through the dermal route.  Liver weight (% body) significantly increased and spleen weight (% body) significantly deceased with PFHxS exposure supported by histopathological changes. Additionally, PFHxS significantly reduced the humoral immune response and altered immune subsets in the spleen, suggesting immunosuppression.  Gene expression changes were observed in the liver, skin, and spleen with genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, necrosis, and inflammation.  Immune-cell phenotyping identified significant decreases in B-cells, NK cells, and CD11b+ cells in the spleen along with increases in CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, NK cells, and neutrophils in the skin.  These findings support dermal PFHxS-induced liver damage and immune suppression.

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2019 or 2018 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates.

Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

This dataset includes data from the retired BRFSS Vision Module. From 2005-2011 the BRFSS employed a ten question vision module regarding vision impairment, access and utilization of eye care, and self-reported eye diseases. In 2013 and subsequently, one question in the core of BRFSS asks about vision: “Are you blind or do you have serious difficulty seeing, even when wearing glasses?” The latest data for this core question can be found in the Vision and Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS). VEHSS is intended to provide population estimates of vision loss function, eye diseases, health disparities, as well as barriers and facilitators to access to vision and eye care. This information can be used for designing, implementing, and evaluating vision and eye health prevention programs.

County counts provide the most up-to-date numbers on cases and deaths by report date.

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch.

These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates.

Masks also slow and deflect cough and exhalation airflows, which changes the dispersion of aerosols. Factors such as the directions in which people are facing (orientation) and separation distance also affect aerosol dispersion. However, it is not clear how masking, orientation, and distance interact. We placed a respiratory aerosol simulator (“source”) and a breathing simulator (“recipient”) in a chamber and measured aerosol concentrations for different combinations of masking, orientation, and separation distance. When the simulators were front-to-front during coughing, masks reduced the 15-minute mean aerosol concentration at the recipient by 92% (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 and 1.8 m separation. When the simulators were side-by-side, masks reduced the concentration by 81% at 0.9 m and 78% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). During breathing, masks reduced the aerosol concentration by 66% when front-to-front (p = 0.0056) and 76% when side-by-side (p < 0.0001) at 0.9 m. Similar results were seen at 1.8 m. When the simulators were unmasked, changing the orientations from front-to-front to side-by-side reduced the cough aerosol concentration by 59% at 0.9 m and 60% at 1.8 m (p < 0.0001 for both). When both simulators were masked, changing the orientations did not significantly change the concentration at either distance during coughing or breathing. Increasing the distance between the simulators from 0.9 m to 1.8 m during coughing reduced the aerosol concentration by 25% when no masks were worn (p < 0.0001) but had little effect when both simulators were masked (4% decrease, p = 0.7090). During breathing, when neither simulator was masked, increasing the separation reduced the concentration by 13%, which approached significance (p = 0.0737), while the change was not significant when both source and recipient were masked (8% decrease, p = 0.3235). Our results suggest that universal masking reduces exposure to respiratory aerosol particles regardless of the orientation and separation distance between the source and recipient.","title":"Efficacy of universal masking for source control and personal protection from simulated respiratory aerosols in a room","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/q8qz-3pb6/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dph/","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-09-29","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-08-25","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/places/measure-definitions/index.html"],"keyword":["prevention","prevalence","brfss","places","place","behaviors","outcomes","city","unhealthy"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"500 Cities Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:places@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/q8xq-ygsk","description":"This dataset contains model-based place (incorporated and census designated places) level estimates for the PLACES project 2020 release.

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates  include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

BCPP was a community randomized trial that examined the impact of prevention interventions on HIV incidence in 15 intervention and 15 control communities. The interventions included extensive HIV testing, linkage to care, and universal treatment services. To reduce HIV incidence in the intervention communities, the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals were used: 90% of HIV-positive persons know their status; 90% of persons who know status are to be on ART; 90% of persons on ART are to be virally suppressed. The BCPP study is composed of 2 interlocking protocols: Evaluation Protocol and Intervention Protocol. The Evaluation Protocol of the BCPP evaluated the primary endpoint (HIV incidence), as well as some key related secondary endpoints. This protocol focused on the Baseline Household Survey; the HIV Incidence Cohort; and an End of Study Survey. The Intervention Protocol of the BCPP implemented the combination prevention (CP) intervention package in CPCs and measures the uptake of these interventions (expanded HIV testing and counselling, strengthened male circumcision, and expanded HIV Care and Treatment).","title":"Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) - Public Release Data","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/qcw5-4m9q/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip"}],"spatial":"Botswana","theme":["Global Health"],"language":["English"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/index.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2020-10-21","temporal":"2020-01-01/2020-12-31","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-04-21","keyword":["nvss","deaths","diabetes","hypertensive disease","kidney disease","major cardiovascular diseases","monthly","mortality","nchs","sex","united states","causes of death","covid-19","coronavirus","cirrhosis","chronic lower respiratory disease","chronic liver disease","age group","age","provisional","obesity"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qdcb-uzft","description":"Provisional death counts of diabetes, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and other select causes of death, by month, sex, and age.","title":"AH Provisional Diabetes Death Counts for 2020","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qdcb-uzft/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qdcb-uzft/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qdcb-uzft/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qdcb-uzft/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qdcb-uzft/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qdcb-uzft/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qdcb-uzft/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/estimates/amd-prevalence.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-05-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-05-15","references":["JAMA-Opthalmology forthcoming","https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology"],"keyword":["visual","vision","prevalence","blindness","blind"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC Info","hasEmail":"mailto:ddtpubsmailbox@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2","description":"VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates\n2017, 2019, 2021, 2022. This dataset contains estimates of the prevalence of visual acuity loss and major eye diseases generated using a Bayesian meta-analytic modeling approach that combines information from multiple data sources to produce comprehensive estimates of prevalence by age, race, and sex at the national, state and county levels. These composite prevalence estimates are the primary surveillance measures developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Vision & Eye Health Surveillance System (VEHSS).  \n\nFor more information about these estimates including summary tables and maps, methods, and links to related publications visit https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/estimates/index.html\nTo view this data in the VEHSS interactive data visualization application, visit https://ddt-vehss.cdc.gov/ and search for “VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimate”.\n\n\nVisual Acuity Loss:\nVisual acuity loss prevalence estimates represent best-corrected visual acuity in the better-seeing eye and are included in rows where Category=’Measured Visual Acuity’.  Rows with Subgroup = ‘Any vision loss' represents any impairment or blindness of 20/40 or worse; rows with Subgroup = 'US-defined blindness' refers to the subset of vision loss that is 20/200 or worse.\n\n\nAge Related Macular Degeneration:\nThe age-related macular degeneration (AMD) estimates represent AMD as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category = ‘Age Related Macular Degeneration’.  The Subgroup ‘Vision threatening AMD’ includes patients with geographic atrophy, wet-form AMD, or choroidal neovascularization in either eye. The Subgroup ‘Non-vision threatening AMD’ includes patients with early or intermediate dry-form AMD defined as retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities or drusen ≥125 µm in the worse-affected eye, and do not have vision threatening AMD.\n\n\nDiabetic Retinopathy:\nThe diabetic retinopathy (DR) estimates represent DR as measured with retinal imaging examination, and are included in rows where Category=’Diabetic Eye Diseases’.  The Subgroup ‘Vision threatening DR’ includes patients with severe non-proliferative DR, proliferative DR, and diabetic macular edema. The Subgroup ‘Non-vision threatening DR’ is defined as patients with mild-moderate non-proliferative DR or unspecified DR, and do not have vision threatening DR.\n\n\nGlaucoma:\nThe glaucoma estimates represent glaucoma as measured with retinal imaging examination and are included in rows where Category=’Glaucoma’. The Subgroup ‘Vision affecting glaucoma’ includes people with glaucoma and abnormal visual field. The Subgroup ‘Non-vision affecting glaucoma’ is defined as people with glaucoma without an abnormal visual field.\n\n\nAge Groups:\nThe VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates are available by major age groups (All ages, ages 0-17, 18-39, 40-64, 65-84, 85+) and detailed (5-year) age groups, which are indicated by the text “by detailed age groups” in the ‘Indicator’ field. \n\n\nPrevalence Data Type:\nThese estimates are also available as crude (Data_Value_Type = ‘Crude Prevalence’) or adjusted data (Data_Value_Type=’Adjusted Prevalence).  Crude Prevalence is the estimate of the actual number and percentage of people living with each condition.  Adjusted Prevalence estimates are adjusted to match the national population by age, race/ethnicity, and sex.  Adjusted prevalence estimates can be used to help identify disparities in prevalence between geographic areas that are not explained by differences in demographic characteristics.\n\n  \nData Sources:\nData sources for VEHSS Composite Prevalence Estimates include the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the American Community Survey (ACS), the National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH), the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Medicare Fee-For-Service claims, the Transformed Medicaid Statistical Information System, MarketScan commercial insurance claim","title":"VEHSS Modeled Estimates","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"theme":["Vision & Eye Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2020-07-22","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-04-21","keyword":["nvss","deaths","puerto rico","state","race","provisional","hispanic origin","all causes","united states","mortality","nchs","coronavirus","weekly","covid-19"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qfhf-uhaa","description":"Effective September 27, 2023, this dataset will no longer be updated.

RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of loss of work due to illness with coronavirus for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included a question about the inability to work due to being sick or having a family member sick with COVID-19. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor work-loss days and work limitations in the United States. For example, in 2018, 42.7% of adults aged 18 and over missed at least 1 day of work in the previous year due to illness or injury and 9.3% of adults aged 18 to 69 were limited in their ability to work or unable to work due to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who did not work for pay at a job or business, at any point, in the previous week because either they or someone in their family was sick with COVID-19.

Data include demographic, clinical, and geographic information; data do not include direct identifiers. Two types of datasets of human Lyme disease case data collected through public health surveillance are available: one includes annual case count aggregated by county of residence according to specific demographic variables and one is line-listed with patient demographic factors, month of illness onset, and clinical presentation information but without corresponding geographic information. These privacy-protected datasets were implemented in accordance with methodology described in Lee et al. Protecting Privacy and Transforming COVID-19 Case Surveillance Datasets for Public Use. Public Health Rep. 2021 Sep-Oct;136(5):554-561. doi: 10.1177/00333549211026817.\n\nLyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991. Different surveillance case definitions have been in effect over time; details are available here: https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/conditions/lyme-disease/. In 2008, a probable case definition was included in public health surveillance for the first time. In 2022, states with a high incidence of Lyme disease started reporting cases based on laboratory evidence alone without requirement for a clinical investigation, precluding comparison with historical data (for more information: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7306a1.htm?s_cid=mm7306a1_w). As such, Lyme disease surveillance data are grouped into separate datasets based on when these major changes occurred; data are provided for download separately for 1992–2007, 2008–2021, and 2022 to current. Data will be updated annually upon final verification of Lyme disease surveillance data by health departments.\n\nData Limitations:\nSurveillance data have significant limitations that must be considered in the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.\n1. Under-reporting and misclassification are features common to all surveillance systems. Not every case of Lyme disease is reported to CDC, and some cases that are reported may be reflect illness due to another cause.\n2. Please note that before the 2022 surveillance case definition went into effect, several states with high Lyme disease incidence had initiated alternative methods of surveillance and those data were not reportable to CDC.\n3. Final case data are subject to each state’s abilities to capture and classify cases, which is dependent upon budget and personnel. This can vary not only between states, but also from year to year within a given state. Consequently, a sudden or marked change in reported cases does not necessarily represent a true change in disease incidence. Every effort should be made to construct analyses to limit overinterpretation of this variation (see the following reference for more context: Kugeler KJ, Eisen RJ.

In this study, a new personal sampling technique was developed for determining the atmospheric concentration of PAA in the workplace. Samples of humidified air containing peracetic acid (concentration range: 25-2000 ppb) were collected on 350-mg XAD-7 solid sorbent tubes to adsorb the analyte. Peracetic acid was desorbed using anhydrous acetonitrile, after which it was treated with excess cyclohexene to generate the corresponding epoxide via the Prilezhaev reaction. The epoxide product was analyzed and quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, indirectly determining the amount of peracetic acid in the original air sample. The specificity for peracetic acid over other contaminants was assessed through a series of hydrogen peroxide (HP) and acetic acid (AA) spiking experiments, in which selectivity for PAA was demonstrated at several different concentrations of both HP and AA. The limit-of-detection (LOD) and the limit-of-quantitation (LOQ) for this method was determined to be 60 ppb and 198 ppb, respectively. Unlike many other methods, the sorbent tube negates the need for solvent in the sampling apparatus, adding to its ease of use. These features as well as inexpensive materials and the use of small, wearable vacuum pumps could allow for implementation of easier personal sampling in the workplace.","title":"Feasibility of a Selective Epoxidation Technique for Use in Quantification of Peracetic Acid in Air Samples Collected on Sorbent Tubes-Dataset","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/r9ns-zmra/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/linked-data/mortality-files/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-05-15","temporal":"1979/2019","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-08-13","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/datalinkage/public-use-linked-mortality-files-data-dictionary.pdf"],"keyword":["sdoh-source-of-health-care","sdoh-crime-violence","sdoh-early-childhood","sdoh-employment","sdoh-environmental","sdoh-food-access","sdoh-language","sdoh-poverty-income","sdoh-workplace","sdoh-food-insecurity","sdoh-civic-participation","sdoh-access-to-health-care","research-data-center","public use files","nchs surveys","linked mortality files","sdoh-housing-quality","sdoh-high-school","sdoh-housing-stability","sdoh-use-of-health-care","sdoh-social-emotional","sdoh-transportation","sdoh-health-literacy","sdoh-higher-education"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"NCHS Data Linkage Program","hasEmail":"mailto:DataLinkage@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/r9nv-zxge","description":"NCHS has linked data from various surveys with death certificate records from the National Death Index (NDI).

The nanoscale is the size range from 1 to 100 nm. Recently, some nanomaterials have demonstrated the ability to enter the brain through the olfactory pathway from the nose to the brain. ⁠This pathway can potentially enable inhaled nanomaterials to enter the brain. Inhalation exposures are technically difficult and expensive. Intranasal instillation is a potential screening tool for evaluating nose to brain transport. However, particles in aqueous media tend to agglomerate and agglomerated particles often act like larger particles in terms of surface area, toxicity, and size thresholds for transport pathways. For neuronal transport within the brain, the upper size limit is estimated to be approximately 100 nm. Therefore, nanomaterials must be adequately dispersed in the vehicle used for instillation in order to evaluate their potential for transport from the nose to the brain.\n\nBecause 100 nm is the upper size limit estimated for transport within the central nervous system, components of dispersion media may need to be different from dispersion media used to evaluate toxicity in other tissues. For example, albumin, a protein which is useful in dispersion media developed for the lung, can interact with nanomaterials and increase their size. In addition, neurons transport sodium out of the cell, suggesting that a dispersion medium to evaluate nose-to-brain transport should avoid high sodium concentrations. To overcome issues with the size of albumin and other proteins as well as the potential effects of sodium and phosphate, we hypothesized that free amino acids, a balanced electrolyte solution, and a mixture of phospholipids could produce a solution that both dispersed nanomaterials and was compatible with neuronal transport. This study describes and characterizes a solution for nasal and olfactory transport (SNOT) that can disperse nanomaterials and dyes with nanoscale dimensions, enabling intranasal instillation so that potential nose-to-brain transport can be evaluated.","title":"Developing a Solution for Nasal and Olfactory Transport of Nanomaterials","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/rbj6-gv57/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/rbrz-y4zd","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-01-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2022-01-12","keyword":["2021","nedss","netss","nndss","tuberculosis","tularemia","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rbrz-y4zd","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1JJ.

An impaction-based aerosol concentration system was developed for focused collection of particles using a multi-stage nozzle that consists of a succession of multiple smooth converging stages. Converging sections of the nozzle were designed to focus and concentrate a particle diameter range of 900 to 2500 nm into a relatively narrower particle beam to obtain particulate deposits with spot diameters of 0.5-1.56 mm. A slightly diverging section before the last contractions was included to allow for better focusing of particles at the lower end of the collectable diameter range. The characterization of this multi-stage nozzle and the impaction-based aerosol concentration system encompassing the nozzle was accomplished both numerically and experimentally. The numerical and experimental trends in collection efficiency and spot diameters agreed well qualitatively; however, the quantitative agreement between numerical and experimental results for wall losses was poor, particularly for larger particle diameters. The resulting concentrated particulate deposit, a spot sample, was analysed using Raman spectroscopy to probe effect of spot size on analytical sensitivity of measurement. The method’s sensitivity was compared against other conventional techniques, such as filtration and aerosol focused impaction, implementing condensational growth.  Impaction encompassing the multi-stage focusing nozzle is the only method that can ensure high sensitivity at Reynolds numbers greater than 2000, that can be supported by small pumps which renders such method suitable for portable instrumentation.","title":"Characterization of a multi-stage focusing nozzle for collection of spot samples for aerosol chemical analysis","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/rdfw-s4u4/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/hus","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-06-12","temporal":"1999/2022","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-09-02","keyword":["american indian or alaska native","asian","black or african american","death rates","drug overdose","health status and determinants","health us","hispanic or latino","men","native hawaiian or other pacific islander","opioid","white","women"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:healthus@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rdjz-vn2n","description":"Data on drug overdose death rates in the United States, by age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, and drug type.

Using acellular, in vitro, and in vivo models, the toxicity of these aerosols was evaluated. An automated electric arc wire thermal spray coating aerosol generator and inhalation exposure system were developed to simulate an occupational exposure in an experimental model. Using the inhalation system, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to stainless steel PMET720 aerosols at 25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 9 d. Lung injury, inflammation, and cytokine alteration were determined. Resolution of the response was assessed by evaluating these parameters at 1, 7, 14 and 28 days after exposure. The aerosols generated were also collected and characterized. Macrophages were exposed to 0 – 200 µg/ml of the collected particles to determine cytotoxicity and screened for known mechanisms of toxicity. Other metal particles similar in composition and morphology, gas metal arc (GMA-SS) and manual metal arc (MMA-SS) stainless steel, were used as particle controls. The influence of pressure used during the process on the toxicity profile of the generated aerosols also was assessed and found to be minimal. The PMET720 thermal spray coating particles exhibited in vitro cytotoxicity and membrane damage only at the highest dose tested. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) showed the PMET720 particles to have oxidative stress potential and caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular oxidative stress. There also was a dose-dependent increase in NF-kB/AP-1 activity. Treatment with uptake inhibitors showed that the PMET720 particles were internalized via clathrin- and caveolar-mediated endocytosis as wells as actin-dependent pinocytosis/phagocytosis. In most of the cell assays, the two welding fume control particles generated a greater response compared to the PMET720 particles. In vivo, lung damage, inflammation and alteration in cytokines were observed 1 day after inhalation exposure, and this response returned to air control exposure levels by day 7. Alveolar macrophages retained the particulate even after 28 days after exposure. The results suggest that compared to stainless steel welding fumes, the PMET 720 aerosols were less potent, and the animals recovered from the acute pulmonary toxicity induced after 7 days.","title":"In vivo and in vitro toxicity of a stainless-steel aerosol generated during thermal spray coating","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/re9g-kq7w/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/rezz-ypcg","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2020-01-17","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-01-07","keyword":["babesiosis","2020","wonder","western equine encephalitis virus disease","nndss","netss","nedss","arboviral diseases"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rezz-ypcg","description":"NNDSS - Table 1D.

Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2016, 2015), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2016, 2011-2015 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening) from the 2015 BRFSS that are the same in the 2018 release as the previous 2017 release.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\n\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\n\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

Prevalence of CWP was related to estimated cumulative dust exposure, age, and rank of coal. On the basis of these data, miners of medium to low rank coal, who work for 40 years at the current federal dust limit of 2 mg/m3, are predicted to have a 1.4% risk of having progressive massive fibrosis on retirement. Higher prevalences are predicted for less severe categories of CWP. Miners in high rank coal areas appear to be at greater risk than those mining medium and low rank coals. Ex-miners who said that they left mining for health-related reasons had higher levels of abnormality compared to current miners.","title":"Prevalence of Pneumoconiosis and its Relationship to Dust Exposure in a Cohort of U.S. Bituminous Coal Miners and ex-Miners","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/rv55-x8ff/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/rw4v-h7j9","issued":"2024-07-24","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-07-24","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Disability and Health Data System (CDC)","hasEmail":"mailto:no-reply@data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rw4v-h7j9","publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"description":"","title":"dhds_dataset","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rw4v-h7j9/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rw4v-h7j9/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rw4v-h7j9/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rw4v-h7j9/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rw4v-h7j9/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rw4v-h7j9/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rw4v-h7j9/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/rwap-xbst","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-24","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-02","keyword":["probable","wonder","2019","all ages","confirmed","invasive pneumococcal disease","nedss","netss","nndss"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/rwap-xbst","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1S.

PLACES is the expansion of the original 500 Cities Project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 29 measures: 4 chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 13 health outcomes, 3 health status, and 9 on using preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2019 or 2018 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2015–2019 or 2014–2018 estimates. The 2021 release uses 2019 BRFSS data for 22 measures and 2018 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours a night). Seven measures are based on the 2018 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

Portable air cleaners were widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic, but they can have drawbacks including noise, space obstruction, and electrical cord safety considerations. Built-in air filtration units are an alternative to provide supplemental air filtration. We conducted a case study of a HEPA air filtration unit installed in the ceiling of a conference room using radial laminar flow or square cone ceiling air supply diffusers. A respiratory aerosol simulator exhaled aerosol particles (0.3 to 10 µm), and the particle concentrations were measured in the personal breathing zones of three breathing simulators representing a speaker and two meeting participants. For the speaker, using one square cone supply diffuser reduced inhalation exposure by 49% to 81% while using two square supply diffusers reduced exposure by 68% to 93%. For the participants, the exposures were reduced by 23% to 64% with one square supply diffuser and 58% to 86% with two square supply diffusers. Results when using the radial supply air diffusers were more variable and more dependent on the simulator layouts. Combining the use of cloth face masks on all simulators with the ceiling unit reduced the speaker’s exposure by 87% to 99% and the participants’ exposures by 84% to 97%. In most cases the ceiling air filtration unit provided protection against simulated respiratory aerosol particles comparable to that seen previously with portable air cleaners.","title":"Reductions in exposures to simulated respiratory aerosols by a ceiling-mounted HEPA air filtration unit","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/saug-ip58/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/saz5-9hgg","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2021-02-24","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-06-17","keyword":["vaccination","covid-19","coronavirus"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"ASPA Media","hasEmail":"mailto:media@hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"HHS ASPA"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/saz5-9hgg","description":"New weekly allocations of doses are posted every Tuesday.

Many state statutes and regulations authorize and define the use of electronic health information (EHI).

However, the detailed molecular pathophysiological mechanisms behind how MDI exposure leading to OA remain poorly understood. Our previous research has shown that MDI or MDI-glutathione (GSH) exposure reduces the levels of endogenous human (hsa) and murine (mmu) microRNAs (miRs), specifically miR-206-3p and miR-381-3p, which were downregulated after MDI-GSH exposure, in turn activates the calcineurin/Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells (NFAT)/inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) signaling axis and the Krüppel-Like Factor 4 (KLF4)/chemokine pathways in macrophages. Prior studies have shown the roles of circular RNAs (circRNAs) species involve in the regulation of miR expression. The circRNA hsa_circ_0008726 is induced by MDI-GSH expression and plays a role to downregulate hsa-miR-206-3p in macrophages. However, the response of MDI-GSH-induced circular RNAs in downregulating hsa-miR-381-3p is not yet known. In this study, the expression of candidate circular RNAs that bind hsa-miR-381-3p was analyzed in differentiated THP-1 macrophages treated with MDI-GSH conjugates using RT-qPCR.","title":"Circular RNA hsa_circ_0099188 Regulates Inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase and Chemokine Transcription in Macrophages by Targeting the hsa-miR-381-3p/PPP3CA and hsa-miR-381-3p/KLF4 Pathways in Response to 4,4’-Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate-Glutathione Conj","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/shsx-r4h8/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/respvaxview/about/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2024-11-20","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"2024-2025","modified":"2025-05-16","keyword":["covid-19 vaccination","rsv vaccination","vaccination","vaccination coverage","nis-acm","vaccine confidence"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"VaxView Team","hasEmail":"mailto:VaxView@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/si7g-c2bs","description":"• National Immunization Survey Adult COVID Module (NIS-ACM): CDC is providing information on the updated 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, the 2024-25 seasonal flu vaccine, and the RSV vaccine uptake and confidence.

Real-time estimates are preliminary and based on continuously collected surveillance data from patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections. The data  come from the Respiratory Syncytial Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network (RSV-NET), a surveillance platform that captures data from hospitals that serve about 8% of the U.S. population. Each week CDC estimates a range (i.e., lower estimate and an upper estimate) of RSV-associated disease burden estimates that have occurred since October 1, 2024.  \n\n<b>Note:</b> Data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Rates for recent RSV-associated hospital admissions are subject to reporting delays; as new data are received each week, previous rates are updated accordingly.  \n\n<b>Note:</b> Preliminary burden estimates are not inclusive of data from all RSV-NET sites. Due to model limitations, sites with small sample sizes can impact estimates in unpredictable ways and are excluded for the benefit of model stability. CDC is working to address model limitations and include data from all sites in final burden estimates.  \n\n\n<b>References</b>\n<ol><li>Reed C, Chaves SS, Daily Kirley P, et al.

It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 40 measures: 12 for health outcomes, 7 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, 3 for health status, and 7 for health-related social needs. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2022 or 2021 data, Census Bureau 2022 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey 2018–2022 estimates. The 2024 release uses 2022 BRFSS data for 36 measures and 2021 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening, and taking medicine for high blood pressure control among those with high blood pressure) that the survey collects data on every other year.

RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of reduced access to healthcare for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about unmet care in the last 2 months during the coronavirus pandemic. Unmet needs for health care are often the result of cost-related barriers. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor cost-related health care access problems in the United States. For example, in 2018, 7.3% of persons of all ages reported delaying medical care due to cost and 4.8% reported needing medical care but not getting it due to cost in the past year. However, cost is not the only reason someone might delay or not receive needed medical care. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, people also may not get needed medical care due to cancelled appointments, cutbacks in transportation options, fear of going to the emergency room, or an altruistic desire to not be a burden on the health care system, among other reasons. The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/reduced-access-to-care.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of reduced access to care during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 1, which started on April 23, 2020). The Household Pulse Survey reports the percentage of adults who delayed medical care in the last 4 weeks or who needed medical care at any time in the last 4 weeks for something other than coronavirus but did not get it because of the pandemic. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who were unable to receive medical care (including urgent care, surgery, screening tests, ongoing treatment, regular checkups, prescriptions, dental care, vision care, and hearing care) in the last 2 months.

Counts of deaths in more recent weeks can be compared with counts from earlier years to determine if the number is higher than expected. Selected causes of death are shown, based on analyses of the most prevalent comorbid conditions reported on death certificates where COVID-19 was listed as a cause of death (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#Comorbidities). Cause of death counts are based on the underlying cause of death, and presented for Respiratory diseases, Circulatory diseases, Malignant neoplasms, and Alzheimer disease and dementia. Estimated numbers of deaths due to these other causes of death could represent misclassified COVID-19 deaths, or potentially could be indirectly related to COVID-19 (e.g., deaths from other causes occurring in the context of health care shortages or overburdened health care systems). Deaths with an underlying cause of death of COVID-19 are not included in these estimates of deaths due to other causes. Deaths due to external causes (i.e. injuries) or unknown causes are excluded.

Despite this prevalence, many of the underlying immunological mechanisms responsible for nickel allergy remain unclear. This knowledge gap is partially attributable to the inherent resistance of laboratory rodents (mice and rats) to dermal sensitization with nickel salts. The fundamental goal of this study was to assess the potential utility of the novel humanized Toll-like receptor-4 (hTLR-4) mouse model for use in future in vivo studies of nickel allergy. Accordingly, hTLR-4 positive and negative mice of both sexes were first incorporated into a Local Lymph Node Assay (LLNA) to evaluate dermal sensitization following topical exposure to soluble nickel salts (NiSO4). The ensuing immune responses were then characterized further by incorporating female and male hTLR-4 positive mice into a non-radioactive endpoint-based assay. Utilizing the same exposure scheme as in the LLNA, mice were euthanized following exposure and the auricular lymph nodes, spleen, and blood were collected to assess various immunological parameters associated with allergy and ACD.","title":"Assessment of dermal sensitization by nickel salts in a novel humanized TLR-4 mouse model","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/uhs4-vv7g/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/art/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-01-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-12-18","keyword":["fertility","success rates","services","infertility","clinic","assisted reproductive technology","art"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"ARTINFO","hasEmail":"mailto:ARTINFO@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ui6g-vumy","description":"ART data are made available as part of the National ART Surveillance System (NASS) that collects success rates, services, profiles and annual summary data from fertility clinics across the U.S. There are four datasets available: ART Services and Profiles, ART Patient and Cycle Characteristics, ART Success Rates, and ART Summary.

Currently, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI induces OA remain an active area of research. Alveolar macrophage dysfunctions play important roles in asthma pathogenesis. Upon exposure to outside stimuli, macrophages are polarized into either classically activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) phenotypes. Macrophage polarization is associated with asthma development where M2 macrophage populations are usually pronounced in lungs of asthmatic patients. Recent in vivo studies demonstrated that M2 macrophage associated markers and chemokines were induced by MDI exposure, indicating that MDI may induce M2 macrophage polarization; however, the underling molecular mechanism(s) by which MDI causes induction of M2 associated markers and chemokines is unclear. M2 macrophage polarization can be regulated by activation of several M2 associated transcription factors; however, whether MDI exposure regulates these transcription factors is unknown. We hypothesize that MDI exposure induces M2 macrophage associate markers and chemokines through upregulation of M2 macrophage-associated transcription factors in macrophages. The first aim of this study is to verify whether MDI-exposure can induce M2 macrophage-associated markers and chemokine expression that were observed in previous studies and to identify candidate M2 macrophage-associated transcription factors in response to MDI exposure that may account for the M2 macrophage polarization. After identification of the candidate transcription factor(s) that can be regulated by MDI-exposure, we investigate the roles of the candidate transcription factor in regulation of these candidate M2 macrophage associate markers and chemokines in relation to the exposure to MDI.","title":"4,4’-Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate Exposure Induces Expression of Alternatively Activated Macrophage-Associated Markers and Chemokines Partially Through Krüppel-Like Factor 4 Mediated Signaling in Macrophages","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/uk9u-uv8c/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/ukww-au2k","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2022-06-17","temporal":"March 27, 2022 - September 24, 2022","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-06-09","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Vaccine Breakthrough Unit, Surveillance and Analytics Team","hasEmail":"mailto:vbtsurveillance@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"CDC"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ukww-au2k","description":"Data for CDC’s COVID Data Tracker site on Rates of COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by Vaccination Status.\nClick 'More' for important dataset description and footnotes\n\nDataset and data visualization details:\nThese data were posted on October 21, 2022, archived on November 18, 2022, and revised on February 22, 2023. These data reflect cases among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 24, 2022, and deaths among persons with a positive specimen collection date through September 3, 2022. \n\nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably completing the primary series of an FDA-authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected.\nAdditional or booster dose: A person vaccinated with a primary series and an additional or booster dose had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after receipt of an additional or booster dose of any COVID-19 vaccine on or after August 13, 2021. For people ages 18 years and older, data are graphed starting the week including September 24, 2021, when a COVID-19 booster dose was first recommended by CDC for adults 65+ years old and people in certain populations and high risk occupational and institutional settings. For people ages 12-17 years, data are graphed starting the week of December 26, 2021, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for adolescents ages 16-17 years. For people ages 5-11 years, data are included starting the week of June 5, 2022, 2 weeks after the first recommendation for a booster dose for children aged 5-11 years. For people ages 50 years and older, data on second booster doses are graphed starting the week including March 29, 2022, when the recommendation was made for second boosters. Vertical lines represent dates when changes occurred in U.S. policy for COVID-19 vaccination (details provided above). Reporting is by primary series vaccine type rather than additional or booster dose vaccine type. The booster dose vaccine type may be different than the primary series vaccine type.\n** Because data on the immune status of cases and associated deaths are unavailable, an additional dose in an immunocompromised person cannot be distinguished from a booster dose. This is a relevant consideration because vaccines can be less effective in this group.\nDeaths: A COVID-19–associated death occurred in a person with a documented COVID-19 diagnosis who died; health department staff reviewed to make a determination using vital records, public health investigation, or other data sources. Rates of COVID-19 deaths by vaccination status are reported based on when the patient was tested for COVID-19, not the date they died. Deaths usually occur up to 30 days after COVID-19 diagnosis.\nParticipating jurisdictions: Currently, these 31 health departments that regularly link their case surveillance to immunization information system data are included in these incidence rate estimates: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, New York City (New York), North Carolina, Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Washington, and West Virginia; 30 jurisdictions also report deaths among vaccinated and unvaccinated people. These jurisdictions represent 72% of the total U.S. population and all ten of the Health and Human Services Regions.

Data used to quantify limits of detection, limits of quantification, bias, precision, and accuracy of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of vapors from 2.5 M PGME solutions are presented. The effects of ethanol as a component of the PGME solution were also evaluated. Liquid drops of PGME solutions and headspace vapors above PGME solutions were released to simulate leaks from Closed System Drug-Transfer Devices (CSTD)s. Using a calibration apparatus, an instrumental LOD of 0.25 ppmv and a LOQ of 0.8 ppmv were determined for PGME vapor. A LOD of 1.1 µL and a LOQ of 3.5 µL was determined for liquid aliquots of 2.5 M PGME solution released in the NIOSH chamber. Accurate quantitation of liquid leaks required complete evaporation of droplets. With the upper end of the usable quantitation range limited by slow evaporation of relatively large droplets and the lower end defined by the method LOQ, the method has a narrow quantitative range for liquid droplets. Displacement of 45 mL of vial headspace containing PGME vapor is the largest amount expected when using the draft NIOSH testing protocol. Release of an unfiltered 45 mL headspace aliquot within the NIOSH chamber was calculated to produce a concentration of 0.8 ppmv based on the Henry’s constant, which is right at the instrumental LOQ.  Therefore, the sensitivity of the method was not adequate to determine leaks of PGME vapor from a headspace release through an air filtering CSTD when using the draft NIOSH testing protocols with an FTIR analyzer.","title":"Evaluation of Propylene Glycol Methyl Ether as a Potential Challenge Agent for Leak Detection of Liquid and Headspace from Closed System Drug Transfer Devices using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/unxy-rdyx/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/uny6-e3dx","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2022-06-16","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"July 2022-June 2023","modified":"2024-01-24","keyword":["vaccination","covid-19","covid-19 vaccination","immunization","vaxviews","nis-ccm","vaccine confidence","vaccination coverage"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"VaxView Team","hasEmail":"mailto:VaxView@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD)"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/uny6-e3dx","description":"National Immunization Survey Child COVID Module (NIS-CCM): CDC is providing information on COVID-19 vaccine confidence to supplement vaccine administration data.

Large amounts of a complex metal aerosol (e.g., Fe, Cr, Ni, Zn) are formed during the process, presenting a potentially serious risk to the operator. Information about the health effects associated with exposure to these aerosols is lacking. Even less is known about the chemical and physical properties of these aerosols. The goal was to develop and test an automated thermal spray coating aerosol generator and inhalation exposure system that would simulate workplace exposures. An electric arc wire- thermal spray coating aerosol generator and exposure system was designed and separated into two areas: (A) an enclosed room where the spray coating occurs; (B) an exposure chamber with different measurement devices and controllers. The physicochemical properties of aerosols generated during electric arc wire- thermal spray coating using five different consumable wires were examined. The generated particles regardless of composition were poorly soluble, complex metal oxides and mostly arranged as chain-like agglomerates and similar in size distribution as determined by MOUDI and ELPI. To allow for continuous, sequential spray coating during a 4-hr exposure period, a motor rotated the metal pipe to be coated in a circular and up-and-down direction. In a pilot animal study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to aerosols (25 mg/m3 x 4 hr/d x 9 d) generated from electric arc wire- thermal spray coating using a stainless-steel PMET720 consumable wire. The targeted exposure chamber concentration was achieved and maintained during a 4-hr period. At 1 d after exposure, lung injury and inflammation were significantly elevated in the group exposed to the thermal spray coating aerosol compared to the air control group. A thermal spray coating inhalation system was designed and constructed that will generate continuous metal spray coating aerosols at a targeted concentration for extended periods of time without interruption for future animal exposure studies.","title":"Development of a thermal spray coating aerosol generator and inhalation exposure system","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/ur6f-kidn/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/usyq-s7ip","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-23","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-02","keyword":["2019","animal","human","nedss","netss","nndss","rabies","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/usyq-s7ip","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1CC.

Estimates less than 10 are suppressed. These early model-based provisional estimates were generated using a multi-stage hierarchical Bayesian modeling process to generate smoothed estimates of the weekly numbers of death, accounting for reporting lags. These estimates are based on several assumptions about how the reporting lags have changed in recent months across different jurisdictions, and the resulting estimates differ from other sources of provisional mortality data.  For now, these estimates should be considered highly uncertain until further evaluations can be done to determine the validity of these assumptions about timeliness. The true patterns in reporting lags will not be known until data are finalized, typically 11–12 months after the end of the calendar year. Importantly, these estimates are not a replacement for monthly provisional drug overdose death counts, or quarterly provisional mortality estimates.

This data is already available on other websites, but this chart brings the information together into one view for comparison.  You can find additional information on the Accelerated and Advance Payments at the following links: \n\nFact Sheet: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/Accelerated-and-Advanced-Payments-Fact-Sheet.pdf; \n\nZip file on providers in each state: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/accelerated-payment-provider-details-state.zip\n\nMedicare Accelerated and Advance Payments State-by-State information and by Provider Type: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-accelerated-and-advance-payments-state.pdf.\n\nThis file was assembled by HHS via CMS, HRSA and reviewed by leadership and compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of December 4, 2020.  \n\nHHS Provider Relief Fund \nPresident Trump is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which provide a total of $175 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.\nThe Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.\n  \nAs part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete. \n\nCMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program\nOn March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS’s Provider Relief Fund.\n\nSince expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers—including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers— during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments. The AAP program is not a grant, and providers and suppliers are required to repay the loan.\n\nCMS has published AAP data, as required by the Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 2021, on this website: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-medicare-accelerated-and-advance-payments-program-covid-19-public-health-emergency-payment.pdf","title":"Provider Relief Fund & Accelerated and Advance Payments","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"US","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"On a continuous basis","theme":["Administrative"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/v2zw-2d2v","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-08-02","temporal":"January 16, 2022 to May 28, 2022","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-08-02","keyword":["covid-19 cases","covid-19 breakthrough","covid-19 vaccination"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Maya Sternberg","hasEmail":"mailto:vbtsurveillance@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"CDC"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2zw-2d2v","description":"Reported numbers of SARS-CoV-2 infections by age group (5–11, 12–17, 18–49, 50–64, ≥65 years of age) from 22 U.S. jurisdictions (AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DC, FL, GA, IN, KS, MI, MA, MN, NC, NE, NJ, NM, NYC, PHL, TN, UT, WI ); ~53% of the U.S. population) with routine linkages between COVID-19 case surveillance and immunization information system (IIS) data reported to CDC during January 16, 2022 – May 28, 2022. \nVaccine administration (coverage) data reported to CDC were aggregated by U.S. reporting jurisdiction, MMWR week of vaccination (≥14 days after completing the primary vaccine series), FDA-approved vaccine products, and age group (5–11, 12–17, 18–49, 50–64, ≥65 years). \nVaccination status: A person vaccinated with at least a primary series had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen collected ≥14 days after verifiably completing BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) primary series. An unvaccinated person had SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen detected on a respiratory specimen and has not been verified to have received COVID-19 vaccine. Excluded were partially vaccinated people who received at least one FDA-authorized vaccine dose but did not complete a primary series ≥14 days before collection of a specimen where SARS-CoV-2 RNA or antigen was detected. \nTo estimate the number of unvaccinated persons in each MMWR week, the 2019 U.S. Census population estimates by jurisdiction and age group were used (except for California, where State Department of Finance 2021 population projections were determined to be more accurate). The number of unvaccinated persons each MMWR week was estimated by subtracting the cumulative number of vaccinated (all products) and partially vaccinated persons (all products) from the respective population totals for each jurisdiction and age group. \nContinuity correction: A continuity correction has been applied to the denominators by capping the percent population coverage at 95%. To do this, we assumed that at least 5% of each age group would always be unvaccinated in each jurisdiction. Adding this correction ensures that there is always a reasonable denominator for the unvaccinated population that would prevent rates from growing unrealistically large due to potential overestimates of vaccination coverage.","title":"Weekly COVID-19 cases among persons ≥5 years old among unvaccinated and vaccinated with a BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) primary series by age group — 22 U.S. jurisdictions, January 16 to May 28, 2022","programCode":["009:031"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2zw-2d2v/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2zw-2d2v/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2zw-2d2v/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2zw-2d2v/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2zw-2d2v/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2zw-2d2v/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2zw-2d2v/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"Select US Jurisdictions","theme":["Public Health Surveillance"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/v4tm-h8pe","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-06-24","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-09-06","keyword":["healthcare-associated infection","haicviz","escherichia coli","enterobacter spp.","carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii","carbapenem-resistant enterobacterales","surveillance","klebsiella spp.","antimicrobial resistance"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"HAIC","hasEmail":"mailto:erib@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v4tm-h8pe","description":"<p>The healthcare-associated infection component of CDC’s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dpei/eip/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">EIP</a> engages a <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dpei/eip/eip-sites.html\" target=\"_blank\">network</a> of state health departments and their academic medical center partners to help answer critical questions about emerging HAI threats, advanced infection tracking methods, and antibiotic resistance in the United States.

Bruusgaard et al. in 2010 pioneered work utilizing a model of synergist ablation to cause hypertrophy followed by denervation-induced atrophy to demonstrate that load-induced gains in myonuclei could be long-lasting after the termination of such exposure.  This finding was consistent with the idea of enduring myonuclear accretion as a form of “muscle memory” allowing enhanced muscle adaptation following a period of detraining.  Subsequent research groups further investigated this possibility in the context of exercise utilizing rodents and various loaded exercise paradigms such as weighted wheel running and ladder climbing.  This research yielded a spectrum of results.  While these studies were instrumental in highlighting the variation in outcomes possible following load-induced hypertrophy in general, they were limited in their direct relatedness to resistance training – the predominate form of exposure utilized to induce hypertrophy.  Our research group has established and repeatedly validated a rat research model to investigate resistance-type training.   The model is based on using a dynamometer to precisely expose dorsiflexor muscles of rats to 8 sets of 10 repetitions (per set) of stretch-shortening contractions (SSCs) – a consecutive sequence of isometric, lengthening, and shortening contractions.  Training with this exposure 3 sessions per week for one month results in increases in muscle mass and performance.  This is accompanied by an increase in muscle fiber area accompanied by a proportional increase in myonuclei number and a rise in overall transcriptional output as measured by total RNA levels.  The purpose of the present study was to determine to what extent alterations in performance, muscle mass, nuclei number, and transcriptional output persist several months following the termination of this relevant and valid model of resistance-type training.","title":"Elevated muscle mass accompanied by transcriptional and nuclear alterations several months following cessation of resistance-type training in rats","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/vagq-bwyc/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/DNPAO/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-01-30","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-08-12","references":["https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpao/index.html"],"keyword":["tv","yrbss","physical activity","soda","obesity","fruit","dnpao","adolescents","vegetables","overweight"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DNPAO Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:dnpaoinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vba9-s8jp","description":"This dataset includes data on adolescent's diet, physical activity, and weight status from Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS).

Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body.","title":"NCHS - Injury Mortality: United States","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vc9m-u7tv/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vc9m-u7tv/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vc9m-u7tv/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vc9m-u7tv/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vc9m-u7tv/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vc9m-u7tv/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vc9m-u7tv/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"United States","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/STATESystem","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2019-02-27","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2023-08-22","keyword":["osh","tobacco","survey questions","qit","office on smoking and health"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vdgb-f9s3","description":"1965, 1966, 1970, 1974-2015, 2017.

These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nNot all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.\r\n\r\nMortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System. Estimates based on fewer than 10 observed deaths are not shown and shaded yellow on the map.\r\n\r\nUnderlying cause of death is based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)\r\n\r\nHeart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20–I51)\r\nCancer (C00–C97)\r\nUnintentional injury (V01–X59 and Y85–Y86)\r\nChronic lower respiratory disease (J40–J47)\r\nStroke (I60–I69)\r\nLocality (nonmetropolitan vs. metropolitan) is based on the Office of Management and Budget’s 2013 county-based classification scheme.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks are based on the three states with the lowest age and cause-specific mortality rates.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths for each state are calculated by subtracting deaths at the benchmark rates (expected deaths) from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nUsers can explore three benchmarks:\r\n\r\n“2010 Fixed” is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2010.\r\n“2005 Fixed” is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2005.\r\n“Floating” is based on the best performing States in each year so change from year to year.\r\n \r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

Headspace from a PAA solution was used to dynamically generate atmospheres of gas-phase PAA which were transferred to PVF bags. The concentration of gas-phase PAA in PVF bags, in a temperature-controlled environment, was measured versus time using both selected ion flow-tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) and impinger based colorimetric measurements. A review of PAA decomposition reactions, kinetics, and results of SIFT-MS measure of PAA and acetic acid are discussed. Gas-phase PAA concentrations in the PVF bags exhibited exponential decay consistent with first-order kinetics. The temperature dependent decay rate of gas-phase PAA concentration in PVF sample bags had half-lives that ranged from 19 h (at 30°C) to 45 h (at 10°C).  From the Arrhenius equation, an activation energy of 34.2±1.1 kJ·mol-1 (8.2±0.3 kcal·mol-1) was calculated from the temperature dependence of the decay constant. In this work, the half-lives of gas-phase PAA concentrations measured in PVF were considerably longer than other studies of PAA in containers.","title":"Decay rate of gas-phase peracetic acid in a polyvinyl fluoride sample bag","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/vqex-u5kb/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/vqff-ff7g","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2016-09-14","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2016-09-14","keyword":["cdc","centers for disease control and prevention"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vqff-ff7g","description":"Source for 2012 national data: National Occupant Protection Use Survey (NOPUS), 2012.

This dataset includes 2015, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015, 2010-2014 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures from the 2014 BRFSS that are the same in the 2017 release as the previous 2016 release.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands. \r\n\r\nU: Unavailable. —: No reported cases.

The “TCAC (Turbulent-mixing, Condensation Aerosol Concentrator)” is composed of a saturator for generating hot vapor, a mixing section where the hot vapor mixes with the cold aerosol flow, a growth tube where condensational droplet growth primarily occurs, and a converging nozzle that focuses the droplets into a beam. The prototype concentrator utilizes an aerosol sample flow rate of 4 L min-1. The TCAC was optimized by varying the operating conditions, such as relative humidity of the aerosol flow, mixing flow ratio, vapor temperature, and impaction characteristics. The results showed that particles with a diameter ≥ 25 nm can be grown to a droplet diameter > 1400 nm with near 100 % efficiency. Complete activation and growth were observed at relative humidity ≥ 25 % of the aerosol sample flow. A consistent spot sample with a diameter of D90 = 1.4 mm (the diameter of a circle containing 90 % of the deposited particles) was obtained regardless of the aerosol particle diameter (dp = 20 – 1900 nm). For fiber counting applications using phase contrast microscopy, the TCAC can reduce the sampling time, or counting uncertainty, by two to three orders of magnitude, compared to the 25-mm-filter collection. The study shows that the proposed mixing-flow scheme enables a compact spot sample collector suitable for handheld or portable applications, while still allowing for high flow rates.","title":"Compact, High-flow, Water-based, Turbulent-mixing, Condensation Aerosol Concentrator for Collection of Spot Samples","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/wa6b-urfv/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/statesystem/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2023-07-18","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-04-01","keyword":["e-cigarette","state system","smokefree indoor air","policy","osh","legislation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wan8-w4er","description":"1995-2025.

Furthermore, exposure to certain chemicals has been linked to inflammatory and allergic diseases. Thus, understanding the immune responses to chemical exposures on the skin and the potential for inflammation and sensitization is needed to improve worker safety and health. Responses in the skin microenvironment impact the potential for sensitization and these responses may include the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, inflammasome activation, barrier integrity, skin microbiota, and the presence of immune cells. Selection of mouse strain to evaluate skin effects, such as haired (BALB/c) or hairless (SKH1) mice, varies dependent on the experimental design and needs of a study. However, dermal chemical exposure may impact reactions in the skin differently depending on the strain of mouse. Additionally, there is a need for established methods to evaluate immune responses in the skin. In this study, exposure to the immunomodulatory chemical triclosan was evaluated in two mouse models using immunophenotyping by flow cytometry and gene expression analysis.  The flow cytometry panel reported in this manuscript in combination with gene expression analysis may be used in future studies to better evaluate the effect of chemical exposures on the skin immune response.  These findings may be important to consider during strain selection, experimental design, and result interpretation of chemical exposures on the skin.","title":"Exposure to the immunomodulatory chemical triclosan differentially impacts immune cell populations in the skin of haired (BALB/c) and hairless (SKH1) mice","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/wepx-mhy6/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/wff4-m3q3","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-01-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2022-01-12","keyword":["probable","nedss","nndss","netss","legionellosis","invasive pneumococcal disease","confirmed","age<5 years","2021","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wff4-m3q3","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1T.

This is the largest nationwide COVID-19 seroprevalence survey to date. De-identified blood samples are tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 to better understand the percentage of people in the United States who have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and to track how this percentage changes over time. Both SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccines currently used in the United States result in production of anti-spike (anti-S) antibodies but only infection results in production of anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) antibodies. Combined seroprevalence estimates the proportion of the population with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 vaccination, or both. It estimates the proportion of the population with some presumed protection against infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.

The present study evaluated the systemic toxicity following a sub chronic 28- day dermal exposure to PFBS (1.25-5%) or PFPeS (1.25-5%) in a murine model. Elevated levels of both PFAS were detected in the serum and urine, suggesting that absorption is occurring through the dermal route. Additionally, both PFAS induced significantly increased relative liver weight, altered serum chemistries, altered skin and liver histopathology, and significantly decreased relative spleen (PFPeS). Gene expression changes were observed in the liver and skin, of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, inflammation, and skin integrity. In general, the toxicity was more dramatic for PFPeS compared to PFBS, suggesting that longer chain PFAS may be more toxic.  These findings support PFAS absorption through the skin leading to liver damage and systemic toxicity.","title":"Systemic toxicity induced by topical application of the sulfonic acids, perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS) and perfluoropentane sulfonic acid (PFPeS), in a murine model","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/wp4g-awc9/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/NHISDataQueryTool/ER_Quarterly/index_quarterly.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-06-03","temporal":"2019-2022","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-06-24","keyword":["sdoh-use-of-health-care","early release","key health indicators","nhis","sdoh-access-to-health-care","sdoh-source-of-health-care"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wpti-gvdi","description":"Interactive Quarterly Early Release Estimates provide health statistics based on data from the 2019-2022 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for selected health topics for adults aged 18 years and over.

We conducted a case study using respiratory simulators to examine the efficacy of portable High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) air cleaners and universal masking at reducing exposure to simulated exhaled aerosol particles from an infected meeting participant in a conference room. We found that, in a room with good air mixing, the use of two HEPA air cleaners meeting the EPA recommended Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) reduced the overall exposure by up to 65%, and that the combination of the HEPA air cleaners and universal masking reduced exposure by up to 90%.

Physicians in the specialties (including designated sub-specialties) of anesthesiology, pathology, and radiology are excluded from the survey. The survey was conducted annually from 1973 to 1981, again in 1985, and annually since 1989. \nData collection from the physician, rather than from the patient, provides an analytic base that expands information on ambulatory care collected through other NCHS surveys. Data about the physician and their practice characteristics are collected during a survey induction interview.\nFor survey years 1973 to 1991, there are two data files: one for patient visit data and a second for drug mention data. The second file is limited to those visits with mention of medication therapy. For the 1991 data, it is possible to link information on the drug file with information on the patient visit file. Beginning with the 1992 survey year through 2011, one main data file was produced annually that contains both patient visit and drug information.","title":"National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, Restricted data, 1973, 1975-1981, 1985, 1989-2016, 2018-2019","isPartOf":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/ahcd/datasets_documentation_related.htm","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://www.cdc.gov/rdc/leftbrch/userestricdt.htm","mediaType":"text/html"}],"spatial":"United States","describedBy":"Findings are based on a sample of visits to nonfederally employed office-based physicians who are primarily engaged in direct patient care. The sampling frame for NAMCS (core sample, not including CHC delivery sites) was composed of all physicians listed in the master files maintained by the AMA and AOA who met the following criteria: -- Office-based or hospital-employed, as defined by the AMA and AOA; -- Principally engaged in patient care activities; -- Nonfederally employed; -- Not in specialties of anesthesiology, pathology, or radiology -- Younger than 85 years of age at the time of the survey. Physicians whom the AMA classifies as “hospital-employed” were added to the sampling frame starting with the 2014 NAMCS. This expansion of the NAMCS physician sampling frame is due to concerns that NAMCS was not covering visits made to office-based practices which are owned by hospitals, and to increases in reported hospital purchases of physician practices in recent years.","accrualPeriodicity":"Dataset will no longer be updated.","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/index.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-11-18","temporal":"2019/2023","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-08-01","keyword":["sdoh-high-school","sdoh-housing-stability","sdoh-poverty-income","sdoh-food-insecurity","sdoh-source-of-health-care","sdoh-use-of-health-care","sdoh-employment","sdoh-workplace","summary health statistics","nhis","sdoh-access-to-health-care","sdoh-food-access","sdoh-higher-education"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wxz7-ekz9","description":"Interactive Summary Health Statistics for Children provide annual estimates of selected health topics for children under age 18 years based on final data from the National Health Interview Survey.","title":"NHIS Child Summary Health Statistics","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wxz7-ekz9/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wxz7-ekz9/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wxz7-ekz9/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wxz7-ekz9/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wxz7-ekz9/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wxz7-ekz9/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wxz7-ekz9/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/wycc-ffia","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2019-05-30","keyword":["nedss","netss","wonder","coccidioidomycosis","cholera","2019","nndss"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wycc-ffia","description":"NNDSS - Table 1H.

PAA typically exists as a mixture with hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, water, and oxygen. These PAA cleaning solutions have been increasingly implemented in occupational settings due to their environmentally friendly decomposition products but the strong oxidative potential that allows them to effectively sanitize surfaces also underlies their ability to damage human airways. PAA mixtures are regarded as an asthmagen and occupational exposure has been associated with acute asthma-like symptoms such as airway and mucosal irritation, cough, wheeze, and shortness of breath. To evaluate the broad effects of PAA vapor exposure to human bronchial cells in vitro, normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells were cultured at the air-liquid interface (ALI) and exposures were conducted to PAA vapors during a four-hour exposure window at four concentrations: 0, 3, 12, and 24 ppm. Cells were allowed to recover for four and twenty-four hours to capture a spectrum of post-exposure response. Data was gathered for cytotoxicity, viability, cell layer integrity (via transepithelial electrical resistance measurements and qualitative histological observations), and protein response for proinflammatory mediators Endothelin-1 (ET-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Interleukin-8 (IL-8).","title":"Peracetic acid effects on human bronchial cells in an air liquid interface","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/wze2-5h6n/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/wzwe-859x","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2022-01-14","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2022-02-11","keyword":["2022","ehrlichia ewingii infection","ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis","giardiasis","nedss","netss","nndss","undetermined ehrlichiosis/anaplasmosis","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/wzwe-859x","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1L.

Data include demographic, clinical, and geographic information; data do not include direct identifiers. Two types of datasets of human Lyme disease case data collected through public health surveillance are available: one includes annual case count aggregated by county of residence according to specific demographic variables and one is line-listed with patient demographic factors, month of illness onset, and clinical presentation information but without corresponding geographic information. These privacy-protected datasets were implemented in accordance with methodology described in Lee et al. Protecting Privacy and Transforming COVID-19 Case Surveillance Datasets for Public Use. Public Health Rep. 2021 Sep-Oct;136(5):554-561. doi: 10.1177/00333549211026817.\n\nLyme disease became nationally notifiable in 1991. Different surveillance case definitions have been in effect over time; details are available here: https://ndc.services.cdc.gov/conditions/lyme-disease/. In 2008, a probable case definition was included in public health surveillance for the first time. In 2022, states with a high incidence of Lyme disease started reporting cases based on laboratory evidence alone without requirement for a clinical investigation, precluding comparison with historical data (for more information: https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/73/wr/mm7306a1.htm?s_cid=mm7306a1_w). As such, Lyme disease surveillance data are grouped into separate datasets based on when these major changes occurred; data are provided for download separately for 1992–2007, 2008–2021, and 2022 to current. Data will be updated annually upon final verification of Lyme disease surveillance data by health departments.\n\nData Limitations:\nSurveillance data have significant limitations that must be considered in the analysis, interpretation, and reporting of results.\n1. Under-reporting and misclassification are features common to all surveillance systems. Not every case of Lyme disease is reported to CDC, and some cases that are reported may be reflect illness due to another cause.\n2. Please note that before the 2022 surveillance case definition went into effect, several states with high Lyme disease incidence had initiated alternative methods of surveillance and those data were not reportable to CDC.\n3. Final case data are subject to each state’s abilities to capture and classify cases, which is dependent upon budget and personnel. This can vary not only between states, but also from year to year within a given state. Consequently, a sudden or marked change in reported cases does not necessarily represent a true change in disease incidence. Every effort should be made to construct analyses to limit overinterpretation of this variation (see the following reference for more context: Kugeler KJ, Eisen RJ.

This research highlights the importance of a comprehensive outbreak investigation, which includes epidemiology, environmental health, and laboratory personnel working together to solve the outbreak.","title":"Characteristics Associated with Successful Foodborne Outbreak Investigations, NEARS 2014 - 2016","programCode":["009:032"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x66v-w5ka/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x66v-w5ka/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x66v-w5ka/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x66v-w5ka/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x66v-w5ka/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x66v-w5ka/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x66v-w5ka/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["Foodborne, Waterborne, and Related Diseases"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.cdc.gov/STATESystem","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2025-01-31","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-01-31","keyword":["tobacco","osh","students","ghpss","gtss"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x6ag-8y7r","description":"2005-2011.

GHPSS is a standardized school-based survey of third-year students pursuing advanced degrees in dentistry, medicine, nursing, or pharmacy. It is conducted in schools during regular class sessions. GHPSS follows an anonymous, self-administered format for data collection. GHPSS uses a core questionnaire on demographics, prevalence of cigarette smoking and other tobacco use, knowledge and attitudes about tobacco use, exposure to secondhand smoke, desire for smoking cessation, and training received regarding patient counseling on smoking cessation techniques. Questionnaires are translated into local languages as needed. GHPSS has a standardized methodology for selecting participating schools and classes and uniform data processing procedures.","title":"Global Tobacco Surveillance System (GTSS) - Global Health Professions Student Survey (GHPSS)","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x6ag-8y7r/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x6ag-8y7r/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x6ag-8y7r/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x6ag-8y7r/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x6ag-8y7r/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x6ag-8y7r/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x6ag-8y7r/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"describedBy":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Global-Survey-Data/Global-Tobacco-Surveillance-System-GTSS-Global-Hea/x6ag-8y7r","theme":["Global Survey Data"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/healthy_people/hp2020/progress-tables.htm","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2022-01-22","@type":"dcat:Dataset","temporal":"1988-01-01/2019-12-31","modified":"2025-04-21","keyword":["sdoh-civic-participation","sdoh-use-of-health-care","sdoh-transportation","sdoh-source-of-health-care","sdoh-social-emotional","sdoh-racism","sdoh-poverty-income","sdoh-literacy","sdoh-language","sdoh-incarceration","sdoh-housing-stability","sdoh-housing-quality","sdoh-high-school","sdoh-higher-education","sdoh-health-literacy","sdoh-food-insecurity","sdoh-food-access","sdoh-environmental","sdoh-employment","sdoh-early-childhood","sdoh-discrimination","sdoh-crime-violence","sdoh-access-to-health-care","healthy people 2020","sdoh-workplace"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Center for Health Statistics"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i","description":"[1] Status is determined using the baseline, final, and target value.

(The percentage of targeted change achieved was equal to or greater than 100%.); (ii) The baseline and most recent values were equal to or exceeded the target.

For objectives that are continuing into Healthy People 2030, more recent data are available on the Healthy People 2030 website: https://health.gov/healthypeople. \n\n\n[3] For objectives that moved toward their targets, movement toward the target was measured as the percentage of targeted change achieved (unless the target was already met or exceeded at baseline): \n\nPercentage of targeted change achieved = (Final value - Baseline value) / (HP2020 target - Baseline value) * 100\n\n\n[4] For objectives that were not improving, did not meet or exceed their targets, and did not move towards their targets, movement away from the baseline was measured as the magnitude of the percent change from baseline: \n\nMagnitude of percent change from baseline = |Final value - Baseline value| / Baseline value * 100\n\n\n[5] Statistical significance was tested when the objective had a target, at least two data points (of unequal value), and available standard errors of the data. A normal distribution was assumed. All available digits were used to test statistical significance. Statistical significance of the percentage of targeted change achieved or the magnitude of the percentage change from baseline was assessed at the 0.05 level using a normal one-sided test. \n\n\n[6] For more information on the Healthy People 2020 methodology for measuring progress toward target attainment and the elimination of health disparities, see: Healthy People Statistical Notes, no 27; available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/sta","title":"Healthy People 2020 Final Progress Table","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"mediaType":"application/rdf+xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/columns.rdf","describedByType":"application/rdf+xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/json","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/columns.json","describedByType":"application/json","@type":"dcat:Distribution"},{"mediaType":"application/xml","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/columns.xml","describedByType":"application/xml","@type":"dcat:Distribution"}],"spatial":"US","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"irregular","theme":["National Center for Health Statistics"],"language":["en-US"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:20"],"landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/x7xw-nitb","issued":"2024-11-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2024-11-20","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Allergy and Clinical Immunology Branch (ACIB), Health Effects Laboratory Division (HELD)","hasEmail":"mailto:sa-cin-webteam@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x7xw-nitb","description":"Perfluoroheptaoinc acid (PFHpA), perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) are synthetic chemicals belonging to the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) group that includes over 5,000 chemicals.  PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFPeA are short-chain PFAS (C7, C6, C5, respectively) that have been labeled as a safer alternative to the legacy PFAS perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS) which have been linked to numerous health effects.  This class of chemicals are incorporated into consumer products such as stain resistant carpeting and textiles, nanosprays, medical devices, and fire-fighting foams.  There is a high potential for occupational exposure and in the environment, short-chain PFAS have been detected in a variety of water sources leading to concerns for dermal exposure, however, these studies are lacking.  In previous studies from our lab, PFOA was demonstrated to be absorbed via the skin and immunomodulatory.  Also, the short-chain PFAS, PFBA, was found to have systemic toxic effects on mice with dermal exposure.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states.

Excess deaths are typically defined as the difference between observed numbers of deaths and expected numbers. This visualization provides weekly data on excess deaths by jurisdiction of occurrence. Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction.

HAVS is characterized by cold-induced vasospasms, finger blanching and changes in sensory function.  Vibration plays a major role in the development of the symptoms that are characteristic of HAVS, however, the hands and fingers of worker using tools are also exposed to pressure applied as the workers grip tools.  The pressure applied by gripping a tool might also affect blood flow and sensorineural function.  Therefore, this study examined the effects of applied pressure [2 and 4 newtons (N)] on peripheral vascular and sensorineural function using a characterized rat tail model.  The tails of rats were exposed to 0, 2 or 4N of applied force for 10 days.  Blood flow (laser doppler) and sensitivity of the tail to pressure (Randall-Selitto pressure test) was measured on days 1, 5 and 10 of the exposure.  The sensitivity of the tail nerves to electrical stimulation was measured on days 2 and 9.","title":"Applied force alters sensorineural and peripheral vascular function in an animal model of hand-arm vibration syndrome","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/xm7q-e7uu/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/xm94-zmtx","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2020-05-28","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-07-07","keyword":["air pollution","ozone","environmental health","asthma"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Craig Kassinger","hasEmail":"mailto:trackingsupport@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"data.cdc.gov"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/xm94-zmtx","description":"This dataset provides modeled predictions of ozone levels from the EPA's Downscaler model.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the static and time-dependent force responses of the rat tail during compression. Compression tests were conducted on male Sprague-Dawley cadaver rat tails using a micromechanical testing system at three deformation velocities and three deformation magnitudes.

Worker exposure to various fractions of crude oil have been linked to mortality, as well as musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, circulatory problems, and cancer.  During the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill, response workers were exposed to a variety of chemical hazards including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heavy metals, as well as components of the oil dispersants employed to disperse the oil.  The Gulf Long-term Follow-up (GuLF) STUDY had reported that workers involved in the cleanup operations experienced adverse hematologic, pulmonary, hepatic, and cardiac problems.  However, long-term neurological effects remain unknown.\n\nHealth Hazard Evaluation (HHE) surveys conducted by NIOSH among the cleanup workers identified a variety of health effects, including neurological symptoms.  Unfortunately, as a significant number of response workers who experienced health symptoms were exposed to both crude oil and the oil dispersant that was aerially sprayed to the contain the spill, the health effects of crude oil exposures alone were difficult to discern from these surveys.  It is here that laboratory-based studies are advantageous as they can provide ample health risk information to establish the toxicological potential of the various chemical hazards at the workplace.  To that end, the present work evaluated the neurotoxic risks of COV generated from the Macondo well crude oil that was used as a surrogate for the DWH crude oil.","title":"Biological effects of inhaled crude oil vapor VI.

Masks and respirators can reduce the transmission of infectious respiratory diseases like SARS-CoV-2 by blocking these aerosols and droplets at the source. The ability of source control devices to block aerosols can be tested by expelling an aerosol through a headform wearing the device. These tests may be performed using constant airflows, which are simpler, or cyclic airflows, which are more realistic but require more complex methods. The purpose of these experiments was to compare the results found using constant vs. cyclic airflows.\n\nA source control measurement system was used to measure the efficacy of two cloth face masks, two medical masks with and without an elastic mask brace, a neck gaiter, and an N95 respirator as source control devices for simulated respiratory aerosols. With this system, the aerosol flows from the inside of the mask toward the outside; that is, the aerosol flows in the same direction as it would flow during an exhalation by a person wearing the source control device. The experiments were conducted under four airflow conditions: cyclic breathing at 15 liters/minute (L/min), cyclic breathing at 85 L/min, constant outward airflow at 15 L/min, and constant outward airflow at 85 L/min. Each experiment began by placing the source control device on the headform and performing a fit test. The measurement system collection chamber was then sealed, and the cyclic or constant airflow and the aerosol generation were initiated. The aerosol concentration in the collection chamber was measured using an optical particle spectrometer (OPS). The source control collection efficiency was determined by comparing the steady-state concentration of aerosol particles in the collection chamber when the source control device was worn with the concentration when no source control device was used.","title":"Constant vs. cyclic flow when testing face masks and respirators as source control devices for simulated respiratory aerosols","programCode":["009:034"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/yp23-fq9k/application/x-zip-compressed","mediaType":"application/x-zip-compressed"}],"theme":["National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/ype6-idgy","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2024-10-18","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2025-02-23","references":["COVID Data Tracker hospital data displays: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#hospitalizations-nhsn   NHSN Hospital Data Reporting: COVID-19 Hospital Data Reporting | NHSN | CDC  Full reporting guidance: https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf"],"keyword":["hospitalizations","hospital capacity","coronavirus","covid-19","admissions","inpatient beds","icu beds","influenza","hospital occupancy"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DHQP","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"CDC"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/ype6-idgy","description":"<b>Note:</b> \nAfter November 1, 2024, this dataset will no longer be updated due to a transition in NHSN Hospital Respiratory Data reporting that occurred on Friday, November 1, 2024.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues.

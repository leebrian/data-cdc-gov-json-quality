Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnotes:C.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.

'Any vision loss' represents any impairment or blindness of 20/40 or worse; 'US-defined blindness' refers to the subset of vision loss that is 20/200 or worse; 'Visual impairment' refers to the subset with visual acuity of 20/40 to <20/200.  \n\nData sources include the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (reference values), the American Community Survey, the National Survey of Childrens Health, and published examination study results from the Baltimore Pediatric Eye Disease Study, the  Chinese American Eye Study, the Eye Diseases Prevalence Research Group, the Los Angeles Latino Eye Study and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis Cohort.","title":"VEHSS Prevalence Estimates - Visual Acuity Loss","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/qeru-k2y2/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","theme":["Vision & Eye Health"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/nt65-c7a7","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2018-06-15","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-06-05","keyword":["injury","mortality","nchs","united states"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/nt65-c7a7","description":"This dataset describes injury mortality in the United States beginning in 1999. Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2). \r\n\r\nData are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nCauses of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD–10). Categories of injury intent and injury mechanism generally follow the categories in the external-cause-of-injury mortality matrix (1,2). Cause-of-death statistics are based on the underlying cause of death.\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).","title":"NNDSS - TABLE 1CC.

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/.

The concept identifier (CUI) is used to aggregate information about that concept, similar to the way NCBI Gene serves as a gateway to gene-related information.\n\nMedGen provides links to such resources as: Genetic tests registered in the NIH Genetic Testing Registry (GTR), GeneReviews, ClinVar, OMIM, Related genes, Disorders with similar clinical features, Medical and research literature, Practice guidelines, Consumer resources, Ontologies such as HPO and ORDO.\n\nLinks to the GTR, GeneReviews, and Practice Guidelines are based on curation by NCBI staff. Other data feeds are automated, but reviewed by NCBI staff and informed by feedback from the community.","title":"MedGen","programCode":["009:041"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/medgen/","mediaType":"text/html","title":"Download MedGen Data"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/medgen/","mediaType":"text/html","title":"Query Interface"}],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/"},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/teenvaxview/index.html","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-07-28","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-09-15","keyword":["adolescent vaccination","hepb","hpv","immunization","menacwy","mmr","sociodemographic data","td","tdap","teen vaccination","vaccination","vaccination coverage","vaxviews"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Julia A.

The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.<br />\nNHIS data are used widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs.<br />\nThe NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).<br />\nWhile the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years. In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.</p>","title":"National Health Interview Survey","programCode":["009:048"],"describedBy":"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/nhis_2012_data_release.htm","dataQuality":true,"license":"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1.0/"},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/4mjx-6na2","bureauCode":["009:38"],"issued":"2021-10-08","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-10-06","references":["https://www.medicaid.gov/dq-atlas/welcome","https://www.mathematica.org/"],"keyword":["dqatlas","dqatlas_devauto","utility"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DataConnect Support Team","hasEmail":"mailto:dataconnectsupport@cms.hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"},"identifier":"0ae93c4e-85f9-5ecb-a850-61cc5875f824","description":"This is a dataset created for use by the DQ Atlas website, and is not intended for use outside that application.

Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nLife expectancy data are available up to 2017. Due to changes in categories of race used in publications, data are not available for the black population consistently before 1968, and not at all before 1960.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br />\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br />\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2006)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2006-nid13603","description":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2006) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2006-nid13603"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/s9bp-7k3m","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2016-09-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2016-09-26","keyword":["centers for disease control and prevention","cdc"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/s9bp-7k3m","description":"Source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 2012 & 2014.","title":"Percentage of Adults Who Report Driving After Drinking Too Much (in the past 30 days), All States, 2012 & 2014","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/s9bp-7k3m/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/s9bp-7k3m/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/s9bp-7k3m/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/s9bp-7k3m/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","theme":["Motor Vehicle"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/5drk-e3yq","bureauCode":["009:38"],"issued":"2021-10-08","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-10-06","references":["https://www.medicaid.gov/dq-atlas/welcome","https://www.mathematica.org/"],"keyword":["dqatlas","dqatlas_featauto","utility"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DataConnect Support Team","hasEmail":"mailto:dataconnectsupport@cms.hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"},"identifier":"935a5667-0da1-56a5-8a7a-e5e4135abd06","description":"This is a dataset created for use by the DQ Atlas website, and is not intended for use outside that application.

It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2018 or 2017 county population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2015 county boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the county level.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br />\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug-related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br />\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 22 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2010)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2010-nid13599","description":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2010) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2010-nid13599"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://medicaid.gov","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2015-06-11","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-02-18","keyword":["drug utilization","medicaid reimbursements","pharmacy"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Medicaid.gov","hasEmail":"mailto:no-reply@data.medicaid.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"},"identifier":"6a91f80f-e2fd-5f43-8e38-afcebebb8387","description":"Drug utilization data are reported by states for covered outpatient drugs that are paid for by state Medicaid agencies since the start of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.

The only variables included in the 8-year 2002-2009 data file are ones that were collected in a comparable manner across all 8 years.<br />\nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Certain questions are asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Also included are questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Demographic information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.<br />\nIn the income section, which was interviewer-administered, a split-sample study had been embedded within the 2006 and 2007 surveys to compare a shorter version of the income questions with a longer set of questions that had been used in previous surveys. This shorter version was adopted for the 2008 NSDUH and will be used for future NSDUHs.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health: 8-Year R-DAS (NSDUH-2002-2009)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-8-year-r-das-nsduh-2002-2009-nid13530","description":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health: 8-Year R-DAS (NSDUH-2002-2009) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-8-year-r-das-nsduh-2002-2009-nid13530"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/x2iq-5477","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-01-04","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2019-01-04","keyword":["2018","acute","by type) c","hepatitis (viral","nedss","netss","nndss","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x2iq-5477","description":"NNDSS - Table II.

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n§ Prior to 2015, CDC's National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) did not receive electronic data about incident cases of specific viral hemorrhagic fevers; instead data were collected in aggregate as \"viral hemorrhagic fevers\".

Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years between 2000 and 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published. Data on age-adjusted death rates prior to 1999 are taken from historical data (see References below).\n\nAge groups for childhood death rates are based on age at death.\n\nSOURCES\n\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, historical data, 1900-1998 (see https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/mortality_historical_data.htm); CDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

State and provider as of May 15, 2020.  This data is already available on other websites, but this chart brings the information together into one view for comparison.  You can find additional information on the Accelerated and Advance Payments at the following links: \n\nFact Sheet: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/Accelerated-and-Advanced-Payments-Fact-Sheet.pdf; \n\nZip file on providers in each state: https://www.cms.gov/files/zip/accelerated-payment-provider-details-state.zip\n\nMedicare Accelerated and Advance Payments State-by-State information and by Provider Type: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-accelerated-and-advance-payments-state.pdf.\n\nThis file was assembled by HHS via CMS, HRSA and reviewed by leadership and compares the HHS Provider Relief Fund and the CMS Accelerated and Advance Payments by State and provider as of December 4, 2020.  \n\nHHS Provider Relief Fund \nPresident Trump is providing support to healthcare providers fighting the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic through the bipartisan Coronavirus Aid, Relief, & Economic Security Act and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, which provide a total of $175 billion for relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the front lines of the COVID-19 response. This funding supports healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 and ensures uninsured Americans can get treatment for COVID-19. HHS is distributing this Provider Relief Fund money and these payments do not need to be repaid.\nThe Department allocated $50 billion of the Provider Relief Fund for general distribution to Medicare facilities and providers impacted by COVID-19, based on eligible providers' net reimbursement. It allocated another $22 billion to providers in areas particularly impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak, rural providers, and providers who serve low-income populations and uninsured Americans.  HHS will be allocating the remaining funds in the near future.\n  \nAs part of the Provider Relief Fund distribution, all providers have 45 days to attest that they meet certain criteria to keep the funding they received, including public disclosure.  As of May 15, 2020, there has been a total of $34 billion in attested payments.  The chart only includes those providers that have attested to the payments by that date.  We will continue to update this information and add the additional providers and payments once their attestation is complete. \n\nCMS Accelerated and Advance Payments Program\nOn March 28, 2020, to increase cash flow to providers of services and suppliers impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded the Accelerated and Advance Payment Program to a broader group of Medicare Part A providers and Part B suppliers. Beginning on April 26, 2020, CMS stopped accepting new applications for the Advance Payment Program, and CMS began reevaluating all pending and new applications for Accelerated Payments in light of the availability of direct payments made through HHS’s Provider Relief Fund.\n\nSince expanding the AAP program on March 28, 2020, CMS approved over 21,000 applications totaling $59.6 billion in payments to Part A providers, which includes hospitals, through May 18, 2020. For Part B suppliers—including doctors, non-physician practitioners and durable medical equipment suppliers— during the same time period, CMS approved almost 24,000 applications advancing $40.4 billion in payments. The AAP program is not a grant, and providers and suppliers are required to repay the loan.\n\nCMS has published AAP data, as required by the Continuing Appropriations and Other Extensions Act of 2021, on this website: https://www.cms.gov/files/document/covid-medicare-accelerated-and-advance-payments-program-covid-19-public-health-emergency-payment.pdf","title":"Provider Relief Fund & Accelerated and Advance Payments","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/v2pi-w3up/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"spatial":"US","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"On a continuous basis","theme":["Administrative"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/3ahs-wye3","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2017-08-23","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-08-13","keyword":["adult","age","any tobacco","cigar","cigarette","current","demographics","ecigarette","e-cigarette","education","ethnicity","gender","glossary","hookah","methodology","national","office on smoking and health","osh","oshdata","pipe","prevalence","products","race","smokeless","smoker","state system","status","surveillance","survey","tobacco","tobacco products","tobacco use","user"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/3ahs-wye3","description":"Download the latest version of the Glossary and Methodology.","title":"National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) Glossary and Methodology","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/3ahs-wye3/application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","mediaType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet"}],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","theme":["Survey Data"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/at7e-uhkc","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2018-11-27","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-06-02","references":["http://www.cdc.gov/BRFSS/"],"keyword":["age-adjusted","behavioral","brfss","factor","risk","surveillance","survey"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DPH Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:PublicInquiriesDPH@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/at7e-uhkc","description":"2011 to present.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2009 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, Adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. In the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2009)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2009-nid13531","description":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2009) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2009-nid13531"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/uu8y-j6ga","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2015-01-20","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-08-13","keyword":["fact sheet"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/uu8y-j6ga","description":"Explore state laws and case law on preemption.\r\n\r\nFor accessibility issues contact OSHData@cdc.gov.","title":"STATE System Preemption Fact Sheet","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/uu8y-j6ga/application/pdf","mediaType":"application/pdf"}],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","theme":["Legislation"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/8s6i-wscf","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2018-01-21","temporal":"2019-04-01T00:00:00+00:00/2019-07-01T00:00:00+00:00","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-08-23","keyword":["cpt codes","hcpcs","ncci edits"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Medicaid.gov","hasEmail":"mailto:Medicaid.gov@cms.hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"},"identifier":"e333cd1e-bf68-5300-aff2-41ad6d166da8","description":"The CMS National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) promotes national correct coding methodologies and reduces improper coding which may result in inappropriate payments of Medicare Part B claims and Medicaid claims. \r\n\r\nNCCI procedure-to-procedure (PTP) edits define pairs of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)/Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes that should not be reported together for a variety of reasons.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates  include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of loss of work due to illness with coronavirus for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included a question about the inability to work due to being sick or having a family member sick with COVID-19. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor work-loss days and work limitations in the United States. For example, in 2018, 42.7% of adults aged 18 and over missed at least 1 day of work in the previous year due to illness or injury and 9.3% of adults aged 18 to 69 were limited in their ability to work or unable to work due to physical, mental, or emotional problems. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who did not work for pay at a job or business, at any point, in the previous week because either they or someone in their family was sick with COVID-19.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br />\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br />\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2007)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2007-nid13522","description":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2007) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2007-nid13522"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/","bureauCode":["009:25"],"issued":"2021-07-01","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-07-01","keyword":["computational biology","tools & utilities"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Library of Medicine","hasEmail":"mailto:custserv@nlm.nih.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Library of Medicine"},"identifier":"https://datadiscovery.nlm.nih.gov/api/views/enpt-7j24","description":"The Primer-BLAST tool uses Primer3 to design PCR primers to a sequence template.

On April 5, 2020, COVID-19 was added to the <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/\"> Nationally Notifiable Condition List </a> and classified as “immediately notifiable, urgent (within 24 hours)” by a Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) Interim Position Statement (Interim-20-ID-01). CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020, to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification. The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. \n\nCOVID-19 case surveillance data are collected by jurisdictions and are shared voluntarily with CDC.

On August 4, 2020, incomplete case counts were replaced with a \"U\" indicating case counts are not available for specified time period. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf.\n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).","title":"NNDSS - TABLE 1N.

These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.\n\nThe hospital population includes all hospitals registered with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of June 1, 2020. It includes non-CMS hospitals that have reported since July 15, 2020. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term “collection_week” signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a “collection_week” of 2020-11-20 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Friday, November 20, 2020, and ending and including reports for Thursday, November 26, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either “_coverage”, “_sum”, or “_avg”.\n<ul>\n<li>A “_coverage” append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A “_sum” append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A “_avg” append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li></ul>\n\nThe file will be updated weekly.

Counts for the most recent final annual data are provided for comparison. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts. To address this, methods were developed to adjust provisional counts for reporting delays by generating a set of predicted provisional counts (see Technical notes). Starting in June 2018, this monthly data release will include both reported and predicted provisional counts.\r\n\r\nThe provisional data include: (a) the reported and predicted provisional counts of deaths due to drug overdose occurring nationally and in each jurisdiction; (b) the percentage changes in provisional drug overdose deaths for the current 12 month-ending period compared with the 12-month period ending in the same month of the previous year, by jurisdiction; and (c) the reported and predicted provisional counts of drug overdose deaths involving specific drugs or drug classes occurring nationally and in selected jurisdictions. The reported and predicted provisional counts represent the numbers of deaths due to drug overdose occurring in the 12-month periods ending in the month indicated. These counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to variations by seasonality. Deaths are reported by the jurisdiction in which the death occurred.\r\n\r\nSeveral data quality metrics, including the percent completeness in overall death reporting, percentage of deaths with cause of death pending further investigation, and the percentage of drug overdose deaths with specific drugs or drug classes reported are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical notes). Reporting of the specific drugs and drug classes involved in drug overdose deaths varies by jurisdiction, and comparisons of death rates involving specific drugs across selected jurisdictions should not be made (see Technical notes). Provisional data will be updated on a monthly basis as additional records are received.\r\n\r\nTechnical notes\r\n\r\nNature and sources of data\r\n\r\nProvisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).\r\n\r\nThe timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.\r\n\r\nProvisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for “12-month ending periods,” defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12-month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12-month ending period in June 2017 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017.

RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of reduced access to healthcare for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about unmet care in the last 2 months during the coronavirus pandemic. Unmet needs for health care are often the result of cost-related barriers. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, is the source for high-quality data to monitor cost-related health care access problems in the United States. For example, in 2018, 7.3% of persons of all ages reported delaying medical care due to cost and 4.8% reported needing medical care but not getting it due to cost in the past year. However, cost is not the only reason someone might delay or not receive needed medical care. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, people also may not get needed medical care due to cancelled appointments, cutbacks in transportation options, fear of going to the emergency room, or an altruistic desire to not be a burden on the health care system, among other reasons. The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/reduced-access-to-care.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of reduced access to care during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 1, which started on April 23, 2020). The Household Pulse Survey reports the percentage of adults who delayed medical care in the last 4 weeks or who needed medical care at any time in the last 4 weeks for something other than coronavirus but did not get it because of the pandemic. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who were unable to receive medical care (including urgent care, surgery, screening tests, ongoing treatment, regular checkups, prescriptions, dental care, vision care, and hearing care) in the last 2 months.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2012 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation.

Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br />\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug-related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br />\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 22 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2011)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2011-nid13586","description":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2011) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2011-nid13586"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/2t2r-sf6s","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2019-11-18","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-03-23","references":["http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/about_nhis.htm","https://www.cdc.gov/visionhealth/vehss/data/national-surveys/national-health-interview-survey.html"],"keyword":["blind","contact lenses","glasses","nhis","vision correction","visual function"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DDT Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:ddtpubsmailbox@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/2t2r-sf6s","description":"2014-15 merged, 2016-17 merged.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2014 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as<br />\nannual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit<br />\ndrugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households<br />\naged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as<br />\nlifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes:<br />\nmarijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants,<br />\nalcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including<br />\npain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey<br />\ncovered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for<br />\ntreatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical<br />\nManual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be<br />\napplied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both<br />\nsubstance abuse and mental health related disorders. Respondents were<br />\nalso asked about personal and family income sources and amounts,<br />\nhealth care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record,<br />\nproblems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing.<br />\nQuestions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the<br />\n2006 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to<br />\n17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such<br />\nas neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends,<br />\nsocial support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance<br />\nabuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes<br />\ntoward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures<br />\nfocused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained<br />\nwere questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of<br />\nusing drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal<br />\nbehavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most<br />\noften were introduced with the 1999 survey.

RANDS is an ongoing series of surveys from probability-sampled commercial survey panels used for methodological research at the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). RANDS estimates are generated using an experimental approach that differs from the survey design approaches generally used by NCHS, including possible biases from different response patterns and sampling frames as well as increased variability from lower sample sizes. Use of the RANDS platform allows NCHS to produce more timely data than would be possible using traditional data collection methods. RANDS is not designed to replace NCHS’ higher quality, core data collections. Below are experimental estimates of telemedicine access and use for three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19. Data collection for the three rounds of RANDS during COVID-19 occurred between June 9, 2020 and July 6, 2020, August 3, 2020 and August 20, 2020, and May 17, 2021 and June 30, 2021. Information needed to interpret these estimates can be found in the Technical Notes. RANDS during COVID-19 included questions about whether providers offered telemedicine (including video and telephone appointments) in the last 2 months—both during and before the pandemic—and about the use of telemedicine in the last 2 months during the pandemic. As a result of the coronavirus pandemic, many local and state governments discouraged people from leaving their homes for nonessential reasons. Although health care is considered an essential activity, telemedicine offers an opportunity for care without the potential or perceived risks of leaving the home. The National Health Interview Survey, conducted by NCHS, added telemedicine questions to its sample adult questionnaire in July 2020.  The Household Pulse Survey (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/telemedicine-use.htm), an online survey conducted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by the Census Bureau in partnership with other federal agencies including NCHS, also reports estimates of telemedicine use during the pandemic (beginning in Phase 3.1, which started on April 14, 2021). The Household Pulse Survey reports telemedicine use in the last 4 weeks among adults and among households with at least one child under age 18 years. The experimental estimates on this page are derived from RANDS during COVID-19 and show the percentage of U.S. adults who have a usual place of care and a provider that offered telemedicine in the past 2 months, who used telemedicine in the past 2 months, or who have a usual place of care and a provider that offered telemedicine prior to the coronavirus pandemic.

This dataset includes 2016, 2015 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2016, 2015), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2016, 2011-2015 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, cholesterol screening) from the 2015 BRFSS that are the same in the 2018 release as the previous 2017 release.

There are also a number of secondary research uses for these data, but one objective of making these data public is to assist health care providers in making informed decisions about their service locations and the beneficiary population they serve.","title":"Market Saturation & Utilization Core-Based Statistical Areas","programCode":["009:000"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/market_saturation_and_utilization_cbsa_dataset_2021-04-16.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Market Saturation and Utilization Release 12 CBSA Dataset File 2021-04-16"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/78b53b65-0e4b-48af-a185-05459882b49d/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"Market Saturation and Utilization Release 12 CBSA Dataset File 2021-04-16"}],"describedBy":"https://data.cms.gov/resources/market-saturation-utilization-core-based-statistical-area-data-dictionary","dataQuality":true,"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"R/P3M","theme":["Medicare"],"language":["en-US"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/u92k-ms37","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-23","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-02","keyword":["vibriosis probable","wonder","netss","2019","nedss","nndss","vibriosis confirmed"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/u92k-ms37","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1LL.

On August 4, 2020, incomplete case counts were replaced with a \"U\" indicating case counts are not available for specified time period. \n\nNote: \nThis table contains provisional cases of national notifiable diseases from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n* Case counts for reporting years 2019 and 2020 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2018 or 2017 county population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br />\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug-related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br />\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 22 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2009)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2009-nid13608","description":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2009) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2009-nid13608"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.metabolomicsworkbench.org/","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2016-07-17","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-03-12","keyword":["national-institutes-of-health-nih"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"MARUVADA, PADMA ","hasEmail":"mailto:maruvadp@mail.nih.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Institutes of Health (NIH)"},"identifier":"37d41112-7b13-4f93-9c6c-f6e0b12f979f","description":"<p>The Metabolomics Program's Data Repository and Coordinating Center (DRCC), housed at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), University of California, San Diego, has developed the Metabolomics Workbench.

The 1997<br />\nquestionnaire (NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE, 1997) introduced new items that the 1998 NHSDA continued on cigar<br />\nsmoking, people who were present when respondents used marijuana or<br />\ncocaine for the first time (if applicable), reasons for using these<br />\ntwo drugs the first time, reasons for using these two drugs in the<br />\npast year, reasons for discontinuing use of these two drugs (for<br />\nlifetime but not past-year users), and reasons respondents never used<br />\nthese two drugs. Both the 1997 and 1998 NHSDAs had a series of<br />\nquestions that were asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These<br />\nitems covered a variety of topics that may be associated with<br />\nsubstance use and related behaviors, such as exposure to substance<br />\nabuse prevention and education programs, gang involvement,<br />\nrelationship with parents, and substance use by friends. Demographic<br />\ndata include gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational<br />\nlevel, job status, income level, veteran status, and current household<br />\ncomposition.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA-1998)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-household-survey-drug-abuse-nhsda-1998-nid13630","description":"National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA-1998) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-household-survey-drug-abuse-nhsda-1998-nid13630"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/equ4-92qe","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-01-20","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-08-17","references":["https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/h6kq-aiu7"],"keyword":["callers","cessation","intervention","national quitline data warehouse","nqdw","office on smoking and health","osh","quit","quitline","quit-now","services","state system"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/equ4-92qe","description":"2010-2020.

County-level provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia, as of the date specified and may not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period. Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts (see Technical Notes).\n\nThe provisional data presented on the dashboard below include reported 12 month-ending provisional counts of death due to drug overdose by the decedent’s county of residence and the month in which death occurred.\n\nPercentages of deaths with a cause of death pending further investigation and a note on historical completeness (e.g. if the percent completeness was under 90% after 6 months) are included to aid in interpretation of provisional data as these measures are related to the accuracy of provisional counts (see Technical Notes). Counts between 1-9 are suppressed in accordance with NCHS confidentiality standards. Provisional data presented on this page will be updated on a quarterly basis as additional records are received.\n\nTechnical Notes\n\nNature and Sources of Data\n\nProvisional drug overdose death counts are based on death records received and processed by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as of a specified cutoff date. The cutoff date is generally the first Sunday of each month. National provisional estimates include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia. NCHS receives the death records from the state vital registration offices through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program (VSCP).\n\nThe timeliness of provisional mortality surveillance data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) database varies by cause of death and jurisdiction in which the death occurred. The lag time (i.e., the time between when the death occurred and when the data are available for analysis) is longer for drug overdose deaths compared with other causes of death due to the time often needed to investigate these deaths (1). Thus, provisional estimates of drug overdose deaths are reported 6 months after the date of death.\n\nProvisional death counts presented in this data visualization are for “12 month-ending periods,” defined as the number of deaths occurring in the 12 month period ending in the month indicated. For example, the 12 month-ending period in June 2020 would include deaths occurring from July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. The 12 month-ending period counts include all seasons of the year and are insensitive to reporting variations by seasonality. These provisional counts of drug overdose deaths and related data quality metrics are provided for public health surveillance and monitoring of emerging trends. Provisional drug overdose death data are often incomplete, and the degree of completeness varies by jurisdiction and 12 month-ending period. Consequently, the numbers of drug overdose deaths are underestimated based on provisional data relative to final data and are subject to random variation.\n\nCause of Death Classification and Definition of Drug Deaths\n\nMortality statistics are compiled in accordance with the World Health Organizations (WHO) regulations specifying that WHO member nations classify and code causes of death with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). ICD provides the basic guidance used in virtually all countries to code and classify causes of death. It provides not only disease, injury, and poisoning categories but also the rules used to select the single underlying cause of death for tabulation from the several diagnoses that may be reported on a single death certificate, as well as definitions, tabulation lists, the format of the death certificate, and regul","title":"VSRR Provisional County-Level Drug Overdose Death Counts","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/gb4e-yj24/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"spatial":"United States","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"Quarterly","theme":["NCHS"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/r9mz-pvtk","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2020-01-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-01-07","keyword":["2020","all ages","confirmed","invasive pneumococcal disease","nedss","netss","nndss","probable","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/r9mz-pvtk","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1S.

Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\n\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\n\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual estimates. Information is provided on the use<br />\n    of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as<br />\n    lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco,<br />\n    and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment<br />\n    history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic<br />\n    criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were<br />\n    also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting<br />\n    from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2015 survey, including questions asked<br />\n    only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug<br />\n    use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes<br />\n    toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on<br />\n    mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking.<br />\n    Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to<br />\n    measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a<br />\n    split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.<br />\n    Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race,<br />\n    age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2015)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2015-nid16893","description":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2015) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2015-nid16893"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/hhqs-3zft","bureauCode":["009:10"],"issued":"2021-02-25","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2014-12-31","keyword":["faers"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"FDA Enterprise Data Inventory","hasEmail":"mailto:FDA_Enterprise_Data_Inventory@fda.hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration"},"identifier":"901A022F-A9B2-4B0A-9A33-0F3D353DF3FD","description":"Public access  allowing for public search of the FDA Adverse Events Database","title":"Public Search for Adverse Events (FOIA)","programCode":["009:002"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/ucm082193","mediaType":"application/xml","description":"Public access  allowing for public search of the FDA Adverse Events Database"}],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/"},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/yjkw-uj5s","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2020-12-07","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-01-04","references":["https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/dataset/PLACES-Census-Tract-Data-GIS-Friendly-Format-2020-/yjkw-uj5s"],"keyword":["behaviors","census tract","gis","outcomes","places","prevalence","prevention","unhealthy"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"500 Cities Public Inquiries","hasEmail":"mailto:places@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/yjkw-uj5s","description":"This dataset contains model-based census tract level estimates for the PLACES project 2020 release in GIS-friendly format. The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census tract 2015 boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the census tract level.

Data on the COVID-19 website and CDC’s COVID Data Tracker are based on these most recent numbers reported by states, territories, and other jurisdictions. This data set of “United States COVID-19 Cases and Deaths by State over Time” combines this information. However, data are dependent on jurisdictions’ timely and accurate reporting. \n\nSeparately, CDC also regularly reports provisional death certificate data from the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) on data.cdc.gov. Details are described on the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">NCHS website</a>. Reporting the number of deaths by using death certificates ultimately provides more complete information but is a longer process; therefore, these numbers will be less than the death counts on the COVID-19 website.\n\n<b>Accuracy of Data</b><br/>\nCDC tracks COVID-19 illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths to track trends, detect outbreaks, and monitor whether public health measures are working. However, counting exact numbers of COVID-19 cases is not possible. COVID-19 can cause mild illness, symptoms might not appear immediately, there are delays in reporting and testing, not everyone who is infected gets tested or seeks medical care, and there are differences in how completely states and territories report their cases.\n\nCOVID-19 is one of about <a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/\">120 diseases or conditions</a> health departments voluntarily report to CDC. State, local, and territorial public health departments verify and report cases to CDC. When there are differences between numbers of cases reported by CDC versus by health departments, data reported by health departments should be considered the most up to date. Health departments may update case data over time when they receive more complete and accurate information. The number of new cases reported each day fluctuates. There is generally less reporting on the weekends and holidays.\n\nCDC reports death data on three other sections of the website: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html\">U.S. Cases</a> & Deaths, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/index.html\">COVID Data Tracker</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/covid-19.htm\">NCHS Provisional Death Counts</a>. The U.S. Cases and Deaths webpages and COVID Data Tracker get their information from the same source (total case counts); however, NCHS Death Counts are based on death certificates that use information reported by physicians, medical examiners, or coroners in the cause-of-death section of each certificate. Data from each of these pages are considered provisional (not complete and pending verification) and are therefore subject to change. Counts from previous weeks are continually revised as more records are received and processed. Because not all jurisdictions report counts daily, counts may increase at different intervals.\n\n<b>Confirmed & Probable Counts</b><br/>\nAs of April 14, 2020, CDC case counts and death counts include both confirmed and probable cases and deaths. This change was made to reflect an <a href=\"https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.cste.org/resource/resmgr/2020ps/Interim-20-ID-01_COVID-19.pdf\">interim COVID-19 position statement</a> issued by the Council for State and Territorial Epidemiologists on April 5, 2020. The position statement included a case definition and made COVID-19 a nationally notifiable disease. Nationally notifiable disease cases are voluntarily reported to CDC by jurisdictions. Confirmed and probable case definition criteria are described here:\n<a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/case-definition/2020/\">https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/case-definition/2020/</a>.

The interventions included extensive HIV testing, linkage to care, and universal treatment services. To reduce HIV incidence in the intervention communities, the UNAIDS 90-90-90 goals were used: 90% of HIV-positive persons know their status; 90% of persons who know status are to be on ART; 90% of persons on ART are to be virally suppressed. The BCPP study is composed of 2 interlocking protocols: Evaluation Protocol and Intervention Protocol. The Evaluation Protocol of the BCPP evaluated the primary endpoint (HIV incidence), as well as some key related secondary endpoints. This protocol focused on the Baseline Household Survey; the HIV Incidence Cohort; and an End of Study Survey. The Intervention Protocol of the BCPP implemented the combination prevention (CP) intervention package in CPCs and measures the uptake of these interventions (expanded HIV testing and counselling, strengthened male circumcision, and expanded HIV Care and Treatment).","title":"Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) - Public Release Data","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/download/qcw5-4m9q/application/zip","mediaType":"application/zip"}],"spatial":"Botswana","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","theme":["Global Health"],"language":["English"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/OpenGovernment/ucm225441.htm","bureauCode":["009:10"],"issued":"2021-02-25","temporal":"2009-01-01/2009-12-31","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2010-10-01","keyword":["h1n1","health","influenza","market","notifications","recalls","safety"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"FDA Enterprise Data Inventory","hasEmail":"mailto:FDA_Enterprise_Data_Inventory@fda.hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Food and Drug Administration"},"identifier":"9cc0d11d-dbcd-41a7-8947-02774d10ce2e","description":"This list is intended to alert consumers about Web sites that are or were illegally marketing unapproved, uncleared, or unauthorized products in relation to the 2009 H1N1 Flu Virus (sometimes referred to as the 'swine flu' virus).","title":"Fraudulent 2009 H1N1 Influenza Products Widget","programCode":["009:000"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"http://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/Transparency/OpenGovernment/ucm225441.htm","mediaType":"application/vnd.ms-excel"}],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/"},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/hk4x-6nkd","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2017-11-03","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-09-28","keyword":["cms-64","expansion population","expenditures","mbes","medicaid","new adult group","viii group"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Medicaid.gov","hasEmail":"mailto:no-reply@data.medicaid.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"},"identifier":"00505e90-f8ac-5921-b12f-5e23ba7ffcf3","description":"This dataset reports summary level expenditure data associated with the new adult group established under the Affordable Care Act.

This dataset includes 2017, 2016 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2017, 2016), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2013-2017, 2012-2016 estimates. Because some questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS, there are 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, pap tests, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleep less than 7 hours) from the 2016 BRFSS that are the same in the 2019 release as the previous 2018 release.

Standardization does not adjust for differences in beneficiaries’ health status.","title":"Medicare Geographic Variation - by National, State & County","programCode":["009:000"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2007%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200819.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"2007 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/36a0a738-7ea5-4ec3-b651-2355d0980e79/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"2007 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2008%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200819.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"2008 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/5f0c88ef-fa56-4711-b2c0-d98a80a91cef/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"2008 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2009%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200819.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"2009 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/6ea48522-11e6-4581-b676-66b4ffcb54a8/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"2009 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2010%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200819.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"2010 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/2976c278-224c-4e92-9660-10a57fc6730e/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"2010 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2011%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200819.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"2011 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/036d5f2a-f126-458f-bb80-c5bf0e28d44e/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"2011 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2012%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200819.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"2012 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/ecfcc384-1e2b-4a2b-b12e-9a26e53f8ce5/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"2012 STATE WDDSE_20200819.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2013%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200818.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"2013 STATE WDDSE_20200818.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/efa3ce57-c9a3-4676-9f20-b1c9e5ba7f3d/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"2013 STATE WDDSE_20200818.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2014%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200818.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"2014 STATE WDDSE_20200818.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/a517bab1-69f9-4166-8e90-33be493761a4/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"2014 STATE WDDSE_20200818.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2015%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200818.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"2015 STATE WDDSE_20200818.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/a001b73e-56d1-4a04-81d6-176fd5a720fd/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"2015 STATE WDDSE_20200818.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2016%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200818.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"2016 STATE WDDSE_20200818.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/data-api/v1/dataset/87f2a6a3-71cb-48eb-af57-4a29a0fc4474/data","mediaType":"text/html","title":"2016 STATE WDDSE_20200818.csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cms.gov/sites/default/files/2020-09/2017%20STATE%20WDDSE_20200818_0.csv","mediaType":"text/csv","title":"Medicare Geographic Variation -

Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Certain questions are asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the census 2010 ZCTA boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the ZCTA level.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

This 20-minute online survey was designed to complement the ability of the federal statistical system to rapidly respond and provide relevant information about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau, in collaboration with five federal agencies, launched the Household Pulse Survey to produce data on the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on American households.  The Household Pulse Survey was designed to gauge the impact of the pandemic on employment status, consumer spending, food security, housing, education disruptions, and dimensions of physical and mental wellness.\n\nThe survey was designed to meet the goal of accurate and timely estimates. It was conducted by an internet questionnaire, with invitations to participate sent by email and text message. The sample frame is the Census Bureau Master Address File Data. Housing units linked to one or more email addresses or cell phone numbers were randomly selected to participate, and one respondent from each housing unit was selected to respond for him or herself. Estimates are weighted to adjust for nonresponse and to match Census Bureau estimates of the population by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and educational attainment. All estimates shown meet the NCHS Data Presentation Standards for Proportions.","title":"Telemedicine Use in the Last 4 Weeks","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/h7xa-837u/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/h7xa-837u/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/h7xa-837u/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/h7xa-837u/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["NCHS"]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:25"],"landingPage":"https://www.nlm.nih.gov/services/research_report_guide.html","issued":"2021-08-26","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-08-26","contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Library of Medicine","hasEmail":"mailto:custserv@nlm.nih.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Library of Medicine"},"identifier":"https://datadiscovery.nlm.nih.gov/api/views/e2kx-fgz7","description":"This chart lists the major biomedical research reporting guidelines that provide advice for reporting research methods and findings.

Unweighted, it contains data from more than 7 million hospital stays each year. Weighted, it estimates more than 35 million hospitalizations nationally. Indicators from this data source have been computed by personnel in CDC's Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention (DHDSP). This is one of the datasets provided by the National Cardiovascular Disease Surveillance System. The system is designed to integrate multiple indicators from many data sources to provide a comprehensive picture of the public health burden of CVDs and associated risk factors in the United States. The data are organized by indicator, and they include CVDs (e.g., heart failure).

TEDS-D provides annual data on the number and characteristics of persons discharged from public and private substance abuse treatment programs that receive public funding.

TEDS-D consists of data reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs, which in turn report it to SAMHSA.<br />\nA sister data system, called the Treatment Episode Data Set -- Admissions (TEDS-A), collects data on admissions to substance abuse treatment facilities. The first year of TEDS-A data is 1992, while the first year of TEDS-D is 2006.<br />\nTEDS-D variables that are required to be reported are called the \"Minimum Data Set (MDS)\", while those that are optional are called the \"Supplemental Data Set (SuDS)\".<br />\nVariables unique to TEDS-D, and not part of TEDS-A, are the length of stay, reason for leaving treatment, and service setting at time of discharge.

This includes information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, gender, race, ethnicity, education, employment status, substance(s) abused, route of administration, frequency of use, age at first use, and whether methadone was prescribed in treatment. Supplemental variables include: diagnosis codes, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, source of income, health insurance, expected source of payment, pregnancy and veteran status, marital status, detailed not in labor force codes, detailed criminal justice referral codes, days waiting to enter treatment, and the number of arrests in the 30 days prior to admissions (starting in 2008) .<br />\nSubstances abused include alcohol, cocaine and crack, marijuana and hashish, heroin, nonprescription methadone, other opiates and synthetics, PCP, other hallucinogens, methamphetamine, other amphetamines, other stimulants, benzodiazepines, other non-benzodiazepine tranquilizers, barbiturates, other non-barbiturate sedatives or hypnotics, inhalants, over-the-counter medications, and other substances.<br />\nCreated variables include total number of substances reported, intravenous drug use (IDU), and flags for any mention of specific substances.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"Treatment Episode Data Set: Discharges (TEDS-D-2006)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/treatment-episode-data-set-discharges-teds-d-2006-nid13581","description":"Treatment Episode Data Set: Discharges (TEDS-D-2006) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/treatment-episode-data-set-discharges-teds-d-2006-nid13581"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/kaeg-w7jc","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2021-07-08","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-07-08","keyword":["child abuse","child welfare"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"HealthData.gov Team","hasEmail":"mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"U.S. Department of Health & Human Services"},"identifier":"https://healthdata.gov/api/views/kaeg-w7jc","description":"A list of the datasets that comprise National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) Findings.","title":"National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System (NCANDS) Findings","programCode":["009:094"],"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","dataQuality":true},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:00"],"landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/kbzc-42jx","issued":"2021-02-17","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-03-13","keyword":["artificial intelligence","blog","blogs","cancer trials","cencer","drigs","lyme","lyme dsease","open data","open innivation"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"HHS Office of the Chief Data Officer","hasEmail":"mailto:healthdata@hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Kristen Honey"},"identifier":"https://healthdata.gov/api/views/kbzc-42jx","description":"This blog post was posted by Kristen Honey, PhD, on November 5, 2018.

CSTE updated the position statement on August 5, 2020 to clarify the interpretation of antigen detection tests and serologic test results within the case classification. The statement also recommended that all states and territories enact laws to make COVID-19 reportable in their jurisdiction, and that jurisdictions conducting surveillance should submit case notifications to CDC. COVID-19 case surveillance data are collected by jurisdictions and reported voluntarily to CDC. \n<br>\nFor more information: \n<a href=\"https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/coronavirus-disease-2019-co","title":"COVID-19 Case Surveillance Public Use Data","describedByType":"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"spatial":"US","describedBy":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/vbim-akqf/files/0eb0e326-d1bd-42a3-a748-acc6d6663326?download=true&filename=data_dictionary_covid_cases_public.xlsx","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"Every 2 weeks","theme":["Case Surveillance"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/dataset/cdc-biosense-tarrant-county-texas","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2012-05-30","temporal":"2007-01-01T00:00:00-05:00/2007-01-01T00:00:00-05:00","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-03-12","keyword":["chronic disease","community health","gastro-intestinal","health care access","health-related behaviors","heat related","infectious disease","injury","other","prevalence","preventive practices","surveillance","trends","upper respiratory","visualization"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"admin","hasEmail":"mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health & Human Services"},"identifier":"2e3a0a06-5e2d-4cbc-8c63-0d54e10978d9","description":"<p>The Tarrant County Public Health (TCPH) and Biosense collaboration is an effort to visualize TCPH health data collected by Biosense using Google Fusion Table technology and make that visualization publicly available.

Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT \"light\" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Certain questions are asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Also included are questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Demographic information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.<br />\nIn the income section, which was interviewer-administered, a split-sample study had been embedded within the 2006 and 2007 surveys to compare a shorter version of the income questions with a longer set of questions that had been used in previous surveys.

The only variables included in the data file are ones that were collected in a comparable manner across all ten years of data.<br />\nThe National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) primarily measures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United States. The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Certain questions are asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Also included are questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Demographic information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.<br />\nIn the income section, which was interviewer-administered, a split-sample study had been embedded within the 2006 and 2007 surveys to compare a shorter version of the income questions with a longer set of questions that had been used in previous surveys. This shorter version was adopted for the 2008 NSDUH and will be used for future NSDUHs.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health: 10-Year Substate R-DAS (NSDUH-2002-2011)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-10-year-substate-r-das-nsduh-2002-2011-nid13609","description":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health: 10-Year Substate R-DAS (NSDUH-2002-2011) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-10-year-substate-r-das-nsduh-2002-2011-nid13609"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/mwk9-wnfr","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2020-07-22","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-07-22","keyword":["age","age group","all causes","alzheimer disease","cancer","causes of death","cerebrovascular disease","chronic lower respiratory disease","coronavirus","covid-19","deaths","diabetes","diseases of heart","hispanic origin","influenza","kidney disease","mortality","natural cause","nchs","nvss","pneumonia","provisional","race","respiratory disease","septicemia","sex","united states"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/mwk9-wnfr","description":"Cumulative provisional counts of deaths sex, race/Hispanic origin, age group, and by select underlying causes of death.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. The dataset includes estimates for 27 measures: 5 chronic disease-related unhealthy behaviors, 13 health outcomes, and 9 on use of preventive services. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/places.","title":"PLACES: Local Data for Better Health, Census Tract Data 2020 release","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cwsq-ngmh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cwsq-ngmh/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cwsq-ngmh/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/cwsq-ngmh/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"describedBy":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/dataset/PLACES-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-Census-Tract-D/cwsq-ngmh","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","theme":["500 Cities & Places"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/dataset/mental-health-treatement-facilities-locator","bureauCode":["009:30"],"issued":"2012-12-14","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-03-12","keyword":["health care providers","help","locator","mental health treatment facilities","provider","psychatrist","psychologist","safety","sexual assault","substance abuse. buprenorphine","suicide prevention","therapy","treatments"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Find Treatment","hasEmail":"mailto:findtreatment@samhsa.hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration, Department of Health & Human Services"},"identifier":"08d3f21c-6ab7-4f78-9590-54eb07ee6670","description":"<p>An online resource for locating mental health treatment facilities and programs supported by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA).

(The percentage of targeted change achieved was equal to or greater than 100%.); (ii) The baseline and most recent values were equal to or exceeded the target. (The percentage of targeted change achieved was not assessed.) \n\n2 - Improved—One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved 10% or more of the targeted change.\n\n3 - Little or no detectable change—One of the following applies: (i) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were available, and the percentage of targeted change achieved was not statistically significant; (ii) Movement was toward the target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had achieved less than 10% of the targeted change; (iii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was not statistically significant; (iv) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved less than 10% relative to the baseline; (v) No change was observed between the baseline and the final data point.\n\n4 - Got worse—One of the following applies: (i) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were available, and the percent change relative to the baseline was statistically significant; (ii) Movement was away from the baseline and target, standard errors were not available, and the objective had moved 10% or more relative to the baseline.\n\n5 - Baseline only—The objective only had one data point, so progress toward target attainment could not be assessed. Note that if additional data points did not meet the criteria for statistical reliability, data quality, or confidentiality, the objective was categorized as baseline only. \n\n6 - Informational—A target was not set for this objective, so progress toward target attainment could not be assessed.\n\n\n[2] The final value is generally based on data available on the Healthy People 2020 website as of January 2020. For objectives that are continuing into Healthy People 2030, more recent data are available on the Healthy People 2030 website: https://health.gov/healthypeople. \n\n\n[3] For objectives that moved toward their targets, movement toward the target was measured as the percentage of targeted change achieved (unless the target was already met or exceeded at baseline): \n\nPercentage of targeted change achieved = (Final value - Baseline value) / (HP2020 target - Baseline value) * 100\n\n\n[4] For objectives that were not improving, did not meet or exceed their targets, and did not move towards their targets, movement away from the baseline was measured as the magnitude of the percent change from baseline: \n\nMagnitude of percent change from baseline = |Final value - Baseline value| / Baseline value * 100\n\n\n[5] Statistical significance was tested when the objective had a target, at least two data points (of unequal value), and available standard errors of the data. A normal distribution was assumed. All available digits were used to test statistical significance. Statistical significance of the percentage of targeted change achieved or the magnitude of the percentage change from baseline was assessed at the 0.05 level using a normal one-sided test. \n\n\n[6] For more information on the Healthy People 2020 methodology for measuring progress toward target attainment and the elimination of health disparities, see: Healthy People Statistical Notes, no 27; available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/sta","title":"Healthy People 2020 Final Progress Table","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/x749-vh2i/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","theme":["NCHS"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/fuzh-wm4c","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-24","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-02","keyword":["2019","nedss","netss","nndss","salmonella paratyphi infection","salmonella typhi infection","salmonellosis (excluding salmonella typhi infection and salmonella paratyphi infection)","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/fuzh-wm4c","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1EE.

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \r\n† Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data).","title":"NNDSS - TABLE 1I.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br />\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br />\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2005)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2005-nid13596","description":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2005) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2005-nid13596"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/6tk5-h85s","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-01-03","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2019-01-03","keyword":["2018","carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae","enterobacter spp.","escherichia coli","klebsiella spp.","nedss","netss","nndss","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/6tk5-h85s","description":"NNDSS - Table II.

Supplemental variables include: diagnosis codes, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, source of income, health insurance, expected source of payment, pregnancy and veteran status, marital status, detailed not in labor force codes, detailed criminal justice referral codes, days waiting to enter treatment, and the number of arrests in the 30 days prior to admissions (starting in 2008).<br />\nSubstances abused include alcohol, cocaine and crack, marijuana and hashish, heroin, nonprescription methadone, other opiates and synthetics, PCP, other hallucinogens, methamphetamine, other amphetamines, other stimulants, benzodiazepines, other non-benzodiazepine tranquilizers, barbiturates, other non-barbiturate sedatives or hypnotics, inhalants, over-the-counter medications, and other substances.<br />\nCreated variables include total number of substances reported, intravenous drug use (IDU), and flags for any mention of specific substances.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"Treatment Episode Data Set: Admissions (TEDS-A-2008)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/treatment-episode-data-set-admissions-teds-2008-nid13576","description":"Treatment Episode Data Set: Admissions (TEDS-A-2008) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/treatment-episode-data-set-admissions-teds-2008-nid13576"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/VirusVariation/","bureauCode":["009:25"],"issued":"2021-06-30","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-07-01","keyword":["genetics","genomics","virus"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Library of Medicine","hasEmail":"mailto:custserv@nlm.nih.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Library of Medicine"},"identifier":"https://datadiscovery.nlm.nih.gov/api/views/3a6v-7cw7","description":"Extension of the Influenza Virus Resource to other organisms, providing an interface to download sequence sets of selected viruses; analysis tools, including virus-specific BLAST pages; and genome annotation pipelines (in progress).","title":"Virus Variation","programCode":["009:041"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/viruses/variation/","mediaType":"text/html","title":"Query Interface"}],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/"},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/9w38-t35p","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2016-09-14","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2016-09-14","keyword":["cdc","centers for disease control and prevention"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9w38-t35p","description":"Source: Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), 2012, 2014.","title":"Percentage of Adults Who Report Driving After Drinking Too Much (in the past 30 days), 2012 & 2014, Region 6 - Dallas","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9w38-t35p/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9w38-t35p/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9w38-t35p/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9w38-t35p/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","theme":["Motor Vehicle"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/9ix3-ryt6","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2016-03-03","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2016-03-03","keyword":["2014","giardiasis","gonorrhea","haemophilus influenzae","mmwr","nedss","netss","nndss","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"wja0@cdc.gov","hasEmail":"mailto:no-reply@data.cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9ix3-ryt6","description":"NNDSS - Table II.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2010 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2010)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2010-nid13572","description":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2010) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2010-nid13572"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/aie4-agrk","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2020-09-11","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-05-24","keyword":["age","age group","census region","coronavirus","covid-19","deaths","hispanic origin","monthly","mortality","nchs","nvss","place of death","provisional","race","sex","united states"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Center for Health Statistics","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aie4-agrk","description":"Deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by month of death, region, age, place of death, and race and Hispanic origin.","title":"AH Monthly Provisional COVID-19 Deaths, by Census Region, Age, and Race and Hispanic Origin","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aie4-agrk/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aie4-agrk/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aie4-agrk/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/aie4-agrk/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"spatial":"United States","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"Ad hoc","theme":["NCHS"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://ii.nlm.nih.gov/MTI/index.shtml","bureauCode":["009:25"],"issued":"2021-06-30","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-07-01","keyword":["history of medicine","terminologies","tools & utilities"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"National Library of Medicine","hasEmail":"mailto:custserv@nlm.nih.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Library of Medicine"},"identifier":"https://datadiscovery.nlm.nih.gov/api/views/ivwm-qssp","description":"A system for producing indexing recommendations to assist in the indexing process at NLM.

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2013 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2013)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2013-nid13555","description":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2013) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2013-nid13555"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/dy4n-fbwg","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2019-04-23","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-01-02","keyword":["2019","nedss","netss","nndss","vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus aureus","varicella morbidity","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/dy4n-fbwg","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1KK.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). State Tobacco Activities Tracking and Evaluation (STATE) System. YRBSS Data. The YRBS is conducted biennially and collects data on a variety of youth risk behaviors including tobacco use. The YRBS uses a two-stage cluster sample design to produce representative samples of students in high schools (grades 9-12). The YRBS uses SUDAAN to calculate asymmetric confidence intervals based on the logit transformation.

Counts of deaths in more recent weeks are compared with historical trends to determine whether the number of deaths is significantly higher than expected.\n\nEstimates of excess deaths can be calculated in a variety of ways, and will vary depending on the methodology and assumptions about how many deaths are expected to occur. Estimates of excess deaths presented in this webpage were calculated using Farrington surveillance algorithms (1). For each jurisdiction, a model is used to generate a set of expected counts, and the upper bound of the 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) of these expected counts is used as a threshold to estimate excess deaths. Observed counts are compared to these upper bound estimates to determine whether a significant increase in deaths has occurred. Provisional counts are weighted to account for potential underreporting in the most recent weeks. However, data for the most recent week(s) are still likely to be incomplete. Only about 60% of deaths are reported within 10 days of the date of death, and there is considerable variation by jurisdiction. More detail about the methods, weighting, data, and limitations can be found in the Technical Notes.","title":"Excess Deaths Associated with COVID-19","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/xkkf-xrst/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/xkkf-xrst/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/xkkf-xrst/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/xkkf-xrst/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"spatial":"United States, Puerto Rico","license":"https://www.usa.gov/government-works","accrualPeriodicity":"Weekly","theme":["NCHS"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/tbfm-vbpp","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2017-08-23","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2020-08-13","references":["https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/d/3ahs-wye3"],"keyword":["adult","age","any tobacco","cigar","cigarette","current","demographics","ecigarette","e-cigarette","education","ethnicity","gender","hookah","national","office on smoking and health","osh","oshdata","pipe","prevalence","products","race","smokeless","smoker","state system","status","surveillance","survey","tobacco","tobacco products","tobacco use","user"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"OSHData Support","hasEmail":"mailto:nccdoshinquiries@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/tbfm-vbpp","description":"2013-2014.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\r\n\r\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\r\n\r\nEstimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision. Death rates are flagged as “Unreliable” in the chart when the rate is calculated with a numerator of 20 or less.\r\n\r\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Estimates should be interpreted with caution.\r\n\r\nSmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3–5). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year during 1999–2015. These annual county-level estimates “borrow strength” across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies (6).","title":"NCHS - Drug Poisoning Mortality by County: United States","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/pbkm-d27e/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","theme":["NCHS"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/t75r-7e4r","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2018-01-21","temporal":"2021-07-01T00:00:00+00:00/2021-10-01T00:00:00+00:00","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-08-23","keyword":["cpt codes","hcpcs","ncci edits"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Medicaid.gov","hasEmail":"mailto:Medicaid.gov@cms.hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"},"identifier":"bdc3cb68-b15c-5a41-82b2-04eccf5f48b5","description":"The CMS National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI) promotes national correct coding methodologies and reduces improper coding which may result in inappropriate payments of Medicare Part B claims and Medicaid claims. \r\n\r\nNCCI procedure-to-procedure (PTP) edits define pairs of Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS)/Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes that should not be reported together for a variety of reasons.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD–10 underlying cause-of-death codes X40–X44 (unintentional), X60–X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10–Y14 (undetermined intent).\n\nEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011–2017 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\n\nDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD–10 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, “Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality” (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\n\nREFERENCES\n1. National Center for Health Statistics. National Vital Statistics System: Mortality data.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br />\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br />\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2008)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2008-nid13624","description":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2008) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2008-nid13624"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://data.cdc.gov/d/6ie8-bpiy","bureauCode":["009:20"],"issued":"2021-01-21","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-10-07","keyword":["2021","nedss","netss","nndss","syphilis congenital","syphilis primary and secondary","wonder"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"CDC INFO","hasEmail":"mailto:cdcinfo@cdc.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"identifier":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/6ie8-bpiy","description":"NNDSS - TABLE 1HH.

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.

Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category.

Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \n\nFootnotes:\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published.\nNC: Not calculated — There is insufficient data available to support the calculation of this statistic.\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\n Max: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\n  * Case counts for reporting years 2020 and 2021 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the U.S., a U.S. territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-U.S. Residents' category. Country of usual residence is currently not reported by all jurisdictions or for all conditions. For further information on interpretation of these data, see https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/Users_guide_WONDER_tables_cleared_final.pdf. \n†Previous 52 week maximum and cumulative YTD are determined from periods of time when the condition was reportable in the jurisdiction (i.e., may be less than 52 weeks of data or incomplete YTD data). \n§ Novel influenza A virus infections are human infections with influenza A viruses that are different from currently circulating human seasonal influenza viruses. With the exception of one avian lineage influenza A (H7N2) virus, all novel influenza A virus infections reported to CDC since 2012 have been variant influenza viruses.","title":"NNDSS - TABLE 1Y.

These are derived from reports with facility-level granularity across two main sources: (1) HHS TeleTracking, and (2) reporting provided directly to HHS Protect by state/territorial health departments on behalf of their healthcare facilities.\n\nThe hospital population includes all hospitals registered with Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of June 1, 2020. It includes non-CMS hospitals that have reported since July 15, 2020. It does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\n\nFor a given entry, the term “collection_week” signifies the start of the period that is aggregated. For example, a “collection_week” of 2020-11-20 means the average/sum/coverage of the elements captured from that given facility starting and including Friday, November 20, 2020, and ending and including reports for Thursday, November 26, 2020.\n\nReported elements include an append of either “_coverage”, “_sum”, or “_avg”.\n<ul>\n<li>A “_coverage” append denotes how many times the facility reported that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A “_sum” append denotes the sum of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li>\n<li>A “_avg” append is the average of the reports provided for that facility for that element during that collection week.</li></ul>\n\nThe file will be updated weekly. No statistical analysis is applied to impute non-response. For averages, calculations are based on the number of values collected for a given hospital in that collection week. Suppression is applied to the file for sums and averages less than four (4). In these cases, the field will be replaced with “-999,999”.\n\nThis data is preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. Data is available starting on July 31, 2020.\n\nSometimes, reports for a given facility will be provided to both HHS TeleTracking and HHS Protect. When this occurs, to ensure that there are not duplicate reports, deduplication is applied according to prioritization rules within HHS Protect.\n\nFor influenza fields listed in the file, the current HHS guidance marks these fields as optional. As a result, coverage of these elements are varied.</li></ul>\n\n</ul>On May 3, 2021, the following fields have been added to this data set.\n<li>hhs_ids\n<li>previous_day_admission_adult_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_confirmed_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_day_admission_adult_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_day_admission_pediatric_covid_suspected_7_day_coverage\n<li>previous_week_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_administered_7_day_sum\n<li>total_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_none_7_day_sum\n<li>total_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\n<li>total_personnel_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum\n<li>previous_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_one_7_day_sum\n<li>previous_week_patients_covid_vaccinated_doses_all_7_day_sum</li></ul>\n\n</ul>On May 8, 2021, this data set is the originally reported numbers by the facility.

Estimated county teen birth rates were obtained using the methods described elsewhere (1,2,3,4). These annual county-level teen birth estimates “borrow strength” across counties and years to generate accurate estimates where data are sparse due to small population size (1,2,3,4). The inferential method uses information—including the estimated teen birth rates from neighboring counties across years and the associated explanatory variables—to provide a stable estimate of the county teen birth rate.\r\nMedian teen birth rate: The middle value of the estimated teen birth rates for the age group 15–19 for counties in a state.\r\nBayesian credible intervals: A range of values within which there is a 95% probability that the actual teen birth rate will fall, based on the observed teen births data and the model.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\nData on the number of live births for women aged 15–19 years were extracted from the National Center for Health Statistics’ (NCHS) National Vital Statistics System birth data files for 2003–2015 (5).\r\n\r\nPopulation estimates were extracted from the files containing intercensal and postcensal bridged-race population estimates provided by NCHS. For each year, the July population estimates were used, with the exception of the year of the decennial census, 2010, for which the April estimates were used.\r\n\r\nHierarchical Bayesian space–time models were used to generate hierarchical Bayesian estimates of county teen birth rates for each year during 2003–2015 (1,2,3,4).\r\n\r\nThe Bayesian analogue of the frequentist confidence interval is defined as the Bayesian credible interval. A 100*(1-α)% Bayesian credible interval for an unknown parameter vector θ and observed data vector y is a subset C of parameter space Ф such that\r\n1-α≤P({C│y})=∫p{θ │y}dθ,\r\nwhere integration is performed over the set  and is replaced by summation for discrete components of θ.  The probability that θ lies in C given the observed data y is at least (1- α) (6).\r\n\r\nCounty borders in Alaska changed, and new counties were formed and others were merged, during 2003–2015. These changes were reflected in the population files but not in the natality files. For this reason, two counties in Alaska were collapsed so that the birth and population counts were comparable. Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003–2015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015. County boundaries are consistent with the vintage 2005–2007 bridged-race population file geographies (7).\r\n\r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nNational Center for Health Statistics.

VSP claims for VEHSS provides a convenience sample of vision insurance members representing approximately more than 1 in 4 of the U.S. population. VSP uses a web-based claims submissions system to collect and process claims. The denominator of the rates represents persons with VSP benefits as reported by employers, and is subject to some uncertainty.  VSP data for VEHSS include Service Utilization and Eye Health Condition indicators.  Certain ophthalmic conditions and procedures are covered by health insurance and are not covered by managed vision insurance, claims based eye disease prevalence may therefore be expected to undercount true prevalence.  Person level claims and person counts are not publically available.  Reported rates were suppressed for de-identification to ensure protection of patient privacy. Detailed information on VEHSS VSP analyses can be found on the VEHSS VSP webpage (link). Information on VSP data can be found on the VSP website (www.vsp.com).

Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2011 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2011)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2011-nid13563","description":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2011) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2011-nid13563"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/w36q-qgu2","bureauCode":["009:38"],"issued":"2021-10-08","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-10-06","references":["https://www.medicaid.gov/dq-atlas/welcome","https://www.mathematica.org/"],"keyword":["dqatlas","dqatlas_devauto","utility"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DataConnect Support Team","hasEmail":"mailto:dataconnectsupport@cms.hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"},"identifier":"4bc725b5-e88e-525c-880b-8547f0edd081","description":"This is a dataset created for use by the DQ Atlas website, and is not intended for use outside that application.

Estimates less than 10 are suppressed. These early model-based provisional estimates were generated using a multi-stage hierarchical Bayesian modeling process to generate smoothed estimates of the weekly numbers of death, accounting for reporting lags. These estimates are based on several assumptions about how the reporting lags have changed in recent months across different jurisdictions, and the resulting estimates differ from other sources of provisional mortality data.  For now, these estimates should be considered highly uncertain until further evaluations can be done to determine the validity of these assumptions about timeliness. The true patterns in reporting lags will not be known until data are finalized, typically 11–12 months after the end of the calendar year. Importantly, these estimates are not a replacement for monthly provisional drug overdose death counts, or quarterly provisional mortality estimates.

This dataset includes 2013, 2014 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2013, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2009-2013, 2010-2014 estimates. More information about the methodology can be found at www.cdc.gov/500cities.\nNote: During the process of uploading the 2015 estimates, CDC found a data discrepancy in the published 500 Cities data for the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates caused when reformatting the SAS data file to the open data format. . The small area estimation model and code were correct. This data discrepancy only affected the 2014 city-level obesity crude prevalence estimates on the Socrata open data file, the GIS-friendly data file, and the 500 Cities online application. The other obesity estimates (city-level age-adjusted and tract-level) and the Mapbooks were not affected. No other measures were affected. The correct estimates are update in this dataset on October 25, 2017.","title":"500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health, 2016 release","programCode":["009:020"],"distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9z78-nsfp/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"text/csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9z78-nsfp/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/rdf+xml"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9z78-nsfp/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/9z78-nsfp/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application/xml"}],"describedBy":"https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities/500-Cities-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-2016-relea/9z78-nsfp","license":"http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/","theme":["500 Cities & Places"]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://medicaid.gov","bureauCode":["009:00"],"issued":"2015-06-11","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-02-18","keyword":["drug utilization","medicaid reimbursements","pharmacy"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"Medicaid.gov","hasEmail":"mailto:no-reply@data.medicaid.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"},"identifier":"acbd1537-69b8-548d-a90f-eedb416acd71","description":"Drug utilization data are reported by states for covered outpatient drugs that are paid for by state Medicaid agencies since the start of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change. Cases are assigned to the reporting jurisdiction submitting the case to NNDSS, if the case's country of usual residence is the US, a US territory, unknown, or null (i.e. country not reported); otherwise, the case is assigned to the 'Non-US Residents' category.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.<br />\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.<br />\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2004)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2004-nid13613","description":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2004) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2004-nid13613"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:00"],"landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/x7e3-j2wa","issued":"2015-10-23","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2015-10-23","keyword":["blog","health data","nih"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"HHS Office of the Chief Data Officer","hasEmail":"mailto:healthdata@hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Audie A.

NNDSS data from the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly on the NNDSS Data and Statistics web page (https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/data-and-statistics.html). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of the time needed to complete case follow-up. Therefore, numbers presented in later weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. The national surveillance case definitions used to define a case are available on the NNDSS web site at https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/. Information about the weekly provisional data and guides to interpreting data are available at: https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/infectious-tables.html. \r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\nU: Unavailable — The reporting jurisdiction was unable to send the data to CDC or CDC was unable to process the data.\r\n-: No reported cases — The reporting jurisdiction did not submit any cases to CDC.\r\nN: Not reportable — The disease or condition was not reportable by law, statute, or regulation in the reporting jurisdiction.\r\nNN: Not nationally notifiable — This condition was not designated as being nationally notifiable.\r\nNP: Nationally notifiable but not published — CDC does not have data because of changes in how conditions are categorized.\r\nCum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\nMax: Maximum — Maximum case count during the previous 52 weeks.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2018 and 2019 are provisional and subject to change.

The survey covered substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and included questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing. Questions introduced in previous administrations were retained in the 2008 survey, including questions asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17. These \"youth experiences\" items covered a variety of topics, such as neighborhood environment, illegal activities, drug use by friends, social support, extracurricular activities, exposure to substance abuse prevention and education programs, and perceived adult attitudes toward drug use and activities such as school work. Several measures focused on prevention-related themes in this section. Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For this 2008 survey, Adult mental health questions were added to measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. A split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions to assess impairment due to mental health problems. Background information includes gender, race, age, ethnicity, marital status, educational level, job status, veteran status, and current household composition.This study has 1 Data Set.</p>","title":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2008)","programCode":["009:030"],"distribution":[{"mediaType":"text/html","downloadURL":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2008-nid13602","description":"National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH-2008) \n","@type":"dcat:Distribution","title":"https://datafiles.samhsa.gov/study/national-survey-drug-use-and-health-nsduh-2008-nid13602"}]},{"accessLevel":"public","landingPage":"https://healthdata.gov/d/y53x-tedw","bureauCode":["009:38"],"issued":"2021-10-08","@type":"dcat:Dataset","modified":"2021-09-09","references":["https://www.medicaid.gov/dq-atlas/welcome","https://www.mathematica.org/"],"keyword":["dqatlas","dqatlas_prodauto","utility"],"contactPoint":{"@type":"vcard:Contact","fn":"DataConnect Support Team","hasEmail":"mailto:dataconnectsupport@cms.hhs.gov"},"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services"},"identifier":"9a44a67b-4623-5bf5-941e-2d28a9874023","description":"This is a dataset created for use by the DQ Atlas website, and is not intended for use outside that application.

The PLACES project is the expansion of the original 500 Cities project and covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia (DC)—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code tabulation Areas (ZCTA) levels. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at 4 geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2018 or 2017 data, Census Bureau 2010 population estimates, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2014-2018 or 2013-2017 estimates. The 2020 release uses 2018 BRFSS data for 23 measures and 2017 BRFSS data for 4 measures (high blood pressure, taking high blood pressure medication, high cholesterol, and cholesterol screening). Four measures are based on the 2017 BRFSS data because the relevant questions are only asked every other year in the BRFSS. These data can be joined with the 2019 Census TIGER/Line place boundary file in a GIS system to produce maps for 27 measures at the place level.

It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations.

These figures accompany this report by presenting information on potentially excess deaths in nonmetropolitan and metropolitan areas at the state level. They also add additional years of data and options for selecting different age ranges and benchmarks.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths are defined in MMWR Surveillance Summary 66(No. SS-1):1-8 as deaths that exceed the numbers that would be expected if the death rates of states with the lowest rates (benchmarks) occurred across all states. They are calculated by subtracting expected deaths for specific benchmarks from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nNot all potentially excess deaths can be prevented; some areas might have characteristics that predispose them to higher rates of death. However, many potentially excess deaths might represent deaths that could be prevented through improved public health programs that support healthier behaviors and neighborhoods or better access to health care services.\r\n\r\nMortality data for U.S. residents come from the National Vital Statistics System. Estimates based on fewer than 10 observed deaths are not shown and shaded yellow on the map.\r\n\r\nUnderlying cause of death is based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10)\r\n\r\nHeart disease (I00-I09, I11, I13, and I20–I51)\r\nCancer (C00–C97)\r\nUnintentional injury (V01–X59 and Y85–Y86)\r\nChronic lower respiratory disease (J40–J47)\r\nStroke (I60–I69)\r\nLocality (nonmetropolitan vs. metropolitan) is based on the Office of Management and Budget’s 2013 county-based classification scheme.\r\n\r\nBenchmarks are based on the three states with the lowest age and cause-specific mortality rates.\r\n\r\nPotentially excess deaths for each state are calculated by subtracting deaths at the benchmark rates (expected deaths) from observed deaths.\r\n\r\nUsers can explore three benchmarks:\r\n\r\n“2010 Fixed” is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2010.\r\n“2005 Fixed” is a fixed benchmark based on the best performing States in 2005.\r\n“Floating” is based on the best performing States in each year so change from year to year.\r\n \r\nSOURCES\r\n\r\nCDC/NCHS, National Vital Statistics System, mortality data (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/deaths.htm); and CDC WONDER (see http://wonder.cdc.gov).\r\n\r\nREFERENCES \r\n\r\n1.

In this Table, provisional cases of selected infrequently reported notifiable diseases (<1,000 cases reported during the preceding year) are displayed.  Note:These are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. Case counts in these tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. Footnote:-: No reported cases    N: Not reportable.    NN: Not Nationally Notifiable.    NP: Nationally notifiable but not published.    Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. * Three low incidence conditions, rubella, rubella congenital, and tetanus, have been moved to Table 2 to facilitate case count verification with reporting jurisdictions. ��� Case counts for reporting year  2015 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf. �� Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. The total sum of incident cases is then divided by 25 weeks. Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf. �� Data for the Arboviral disease, Chikungunya, and Hantavirus infection disease, non-Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS), will be displayed in this table after the CDC obtains Office of Management and Budget Paperwork Reduction Act approval to receive data for these conditions. ** Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance).

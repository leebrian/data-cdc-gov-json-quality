National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia as of the date specified that have been received and coded. It is important to note that it can take several weeks for death records to be submitted to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, and tabulated. Therefore, the data shown on this page may be incomplete, and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period especially for the more recent time periods. Death counts for earlier weeks are continually revised and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1-2 weeks.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe provisional data presented on this page include the weekly provisional count of deaths in the United States due to COVID-19, deaths from all causes and percent of expected deaths (i.e., number of deaths received over number of deaths expected based on data from previous years), pneumonia deaths (excluding pneumonia deaths involving influenza), and pneumonia deaths involving COVID-19; (a) by week ending date, (b) by age at death, and (c) by specific jurisdictions. Future updates to this release may include additional detail such as demographic characteristics (e.g., sex), additional causes of death (e.g., acute respiratory distress syndrome or other comorbidities), or estimates based on models that account for reporting delays to generate more accurate predicted provisional counts.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPneumonia deaths are included to provide context for understanding the completeness of COVID-19 mortality data and related trends. Deaths due to COVID-19 may be misclassified as pneumonia deaths in the absence of positive test results, and pneumonia may appear on death certificates as a comorbid condition. Thus, increases in pneumonia deaths may be an indicator of excess COVID-19-related mortality. Additionally, estimates of completeness for pneumonia deaths may provide context for understanding the lag in reporting for COVID-19 deaths, as it is anticipated that these causes would have similar delays in reporting, processing, and coding. However, it is possible that reporting of COVID-19 mortality may be slower or faster than for other causes of death, and that the delay may change over time. Analyses to better understand and quantify reporting delays for COVID-19 deaths and related causes are underway. The list of causes provided in these tables may expand in future releases as more data are received, and other potentially comorbid conditions are determined.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETechnical notes\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EComparing data in this report to other sources\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProvisional death counts in this report will not match counts in other sources, such as media reports or numbers from county health departments. Death data, once received and processed by National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), are tabulated by the state or jurisdiction in which the death occurred. Death counts are not tabulated by the decedent\u2019s state of residence. COVID-19 deaths may also be classified or defined differently in various reporting and surveillance systems.  Death counts in this report include laboratory confirmed COVID-19 deaths and clinically confirmed COVID-19 deaths. This includes deaths where COVID-19 is listed as a \u201cpresumed\u201d or \u201cprobable\u201d cause.  Some local and state health departments only report laboratory-confirmed COVID deaths.  This may partly account for differences between NCHS reported death counts and death counts reported in other sources. Provisional counts reported here track approximately 1\u20132 weeks behind other published data sources on the number of COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. (1,2,3).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENature and sources of data\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EProvisional death c\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https:\/\/data.cdc.gov\/api\/views\/hc4f-j6nb\/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"csv","title":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https:\/\/data.cdc.gov\/api\/views\/hc4f-j6nb\/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"rdf","title":"rdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https:\/\/data.cdc.gov\/api\/views\/hc4f-j6nb\/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"json","title":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","downloadURL":"https:\/\/data.cdc.gov\/api\/views\/hc4f-j6nb\/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"xsl","title":"xsl"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/data.cdc.gov\/api\/views\/hc4f-j6nb","issued":"2020-04-23","keyword":["age","coronavirus","covid-19","deaths","mortality","nchs","pneumonia","state","united states"],"landingPage":"https:\/\/data.cdc.gov\/d\/hc4f-j6nb","modified":"2020-04-23","programCode":["009:020"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"},"temporal":"2019-01-01T05:00:00-05:00\/2020-12-31T05:00:00-05:00","theme":["NCHS"],"title":"Provisional Death Counts for Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:20"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"SVI Coordinator","hasEmail":"mailto:svi_coordinator@cdc.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003EATSDR\u2019s Geospatial Research, Analysis \u0026amp; Services Program (GRASP) created Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (CDC SVI or simply SVI, hereafter) to help public health officials and emergency response planners identify and map the communities that will most likely need support before, during, and after a hazardous event.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESVI indicates the relative vulnerability of every U.S. Census tract.

demographic variables. In this release, counts of deaths are provided by the race and Hispanic origin of the decedent. Topics will be added to the release as they become available.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese provisional counts are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System. National provisional counts include deaths occurring within the 50 states and the District of Columbia that have been received and coded as of the date specified. Data shown on this page may be incomplete and will likely not include all deaths that occurred during a given time period, especially for the more recent time periods. Data on this page are revised weekly and may increase or decrease as new and updated death certificate data are received from the states by NCHS. COVID-19 death counts shown here may differ from other published sources, as data currently are lagged by an average of 1\u20132 weeks.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWeighted population distributions more accurately reflect race\/ethnic distributions of the geographic locations where COVID outbreaks are occurring (see below for the methods used to calculate weighted percentages). The weighted population distributions ensure that the population estimates and percentages of COVID-19 deaths represent comparable geographic areas, in order to provide information about whether certain racial and ethnic subgroups are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. See Table 2 below for unweighted populations.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEstimated distributions of COVID-19 deaths and population size by race and Hispanic origin\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe percentages of COVID-19 deaths by race and Hispanic origin were calculated by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths for each race and Hispanic origin group by the total number of COVID-19 deaths. Percentages may not sum to 100 due to rounding. The distribution of deaths involving COVID-19 by race\/ethnicity should not be compared to the race\/ethnicity distribution of the U.S. population because COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in certain geographic locations where the racial and ethnic population distribution differs from that of the United States overall. Additionally, COVID-19 deaths are concentrated in certain areas within states, and it is therefore not appropriate to compare the percent of COVID-19 deaths by race\/ethnicity to the racial\/ethnic population distribution of a given state.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo make the estimated population distribution more comparable to the geographic areas where COVID-19 deaths are occurring, weighted population distributions are provided in this report. The weighted population distributions were calculated as follows. County-level population counts by race and Hispanic origin were multiplied by the corresponding total count of COVID-19 deaths by county (of residence). These weighted counts were then summed to the state (or national) level. The percentage of the population within each race and Hispanic origin group by state (or for the U.S.) was then estimated using these weighted counts. Counties with no COVID-19 deaths received a weight of zero, and thus do not contribute to the weighted population totals. Population counts for counties with large numbers of COVID-19 deaths are upweighted proportional to their numbers of COVID-19 deaths. These weighted population distributions ensure that the population estimates and percentages of COVID-19 deaths represent comparable geographic areas, in order to provide information about whether certain racial and ethnic subgroups are experiencing a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. For example, assume that 75% of the total number of COVID deaths occurred in a single county, County X, while the other 25% of COVID deaths occurred in County Y, and all other counties reported zero deaths. The weighted population counts for County X would contribute 75% of the total population counts, while the population counts for

Provisional counts are often incomplete and causes of death may be pending investigation (see Technical notes) resulting in an underestimate relative to final counts.

Additionally, Kalawao County, a remote island county in Hawaii, recorded no births, and census estimates indicated a denominator of 0 (i.e., no females between the ages of 15 and 19 years residing in the county from 2003 through 2015). For this reason, Kalawao County was removed from the analysis. Also , Bedford City, Virginia, was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. For consistency, Bedford City was merged with Bedford County, Virginia, for the entire 2003\u20132015 period. Final analysis was conducted on 3,137 counties for each year from 2003 through 2015.

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132016 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDeath rates for some states and years may be low due to a high number of unresolved pending cases or misclassification of ICD\u201310 codes for unintentional poisoning as R99, \u201cOther ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\u201d (2). For example, this issue is known to affect New Jersey in 2009 and West Virginia in 2005 and 2009 but also may affect other years and other states. Drug poisoning death rates may be underestimated in those instances.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESmoothed county age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 population) were obtained according to methods described elsewhere (3\u20135). Briefly, two-stage hierarchical models were used to generate empirical Bayes estimates of county age-adjusted death rates due to drug poisoning for each year. These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates for 1999-2015 have been updated, and may differ slightly from previously published estimates. Differences are expected to be minimal, and may result from different county boundaries used in this release (see below) and from the inclusion of an additional year of data. Previously published estimates can be found here for comparison.(6) Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colorado, and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (7,8). Additionally, Clifton Forge County, Virginia only appears on the mortality files prior to 2003, while Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015. These counties were therefore merged with adjacent counties where necessary to create a consistent set of geographic units across the time period. County boundaries are largely consistent with the vintage 2005-2007 bridged-race population file geographies, with the modifications noted previously (7,8).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EREFERENCES\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n1.

Two concepts are included in the circumstances of an injury death: intent of injury and mechanism of injury. Intent of injury describes whether the injury was inflicted purposefully (intentional injury) and, if purposeful, whether the injury was self-inflicted (suicide or self-harm) or inflicted by another person (homicide). Injuries that were not purposefully inflicted are considered unintentional (accidental) injuries. Mechanism of injury describes the source of the energy transfer that resulted in physical or physiological harm to the body. Examples of mechanisms of injury include falls, motor vehicle traffic crashes, burns, poisonings, and drownings (1,2).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EData are based on information from all resident death certificates filed in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Age-adjusted death rates (per 100,000 standard population) are based on the 2000 U.S. standard population. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 census, estimated as of July 1, 2010. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for non-census years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECauses of injury death are classified by the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD\u201310).

These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5).

Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having ICD\u201310 underlying cause-of-death codes X40\u2013X44 (unintentional), X60\u2013X64 (suicide), X85 (homicide), or Y10\u2013Y14 (undetermined intent).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEstimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files (1). Age-adjusted death rates (deaths per 100,000 U.S. standard population for 2000) are calculated using the direct method. Populations used for computing death rates for 2011\u20132015 are postcensal estimates based on the 2010 U.S. census. Rates for census years are based on populations enumerated in the corresponding censuses. Rates for noncensus years before 2010 are revised using updated intercensal population estimates and may differ from rates previously published.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEstimate does not meet standards of reliability or precision.

These annual county-level estimates \u201cborrow strength\u201d across counties to generate stable estimates of death rates where data are sparse due to small population size (3,5). Estimates are unavailable for Broomfield County, Colo., and Denali County, Alaska, before 2003 (6,7). Additionally, Bedford City, Virginia was added to Bedford County in 2015 and no longer appears in the mortality file in 2015.

Tracking Network. The EPA maintains a database called the Air Quality System (AQS) which contains data from approximately 4,000 monitoring stations around the country, mainly in urban areas. Data from the AQS is considered the \u0022gold standard\u0022 for determining outdoor air pollution. However, AQS data are limited because the monitoring stations are usually in urban areas or cities and because they only take air samples for some air pollutants every three days or during times of the year when air pollution is very high. CDC and EPA have worked together to develop a statistical model (Downscaler) to make modeled predictions available for environmental public health tracking purposes in areas of the country that do not have monitors and to fill in the time gaps when monitors may not be recording data. This data does not include \u0022Percent of population in counties exceeding NAAQS (vs. population in counties that either meet the standard or do not monitor PM2.5)\u0022.

Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2015, 2014), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2011-2015, 2010-2014 estimates.

This dataset includes 2016, 2015 model-based small area estimates for 27 measures of chronic disease related to unhealthy behaviors (5), health outcomes (13), and use of preventive services (9). Data were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. The project was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. It represents a first-of-its kind effort to release information on a large scale for cities and for small areas within those cities. It includes estimates for the 500 largest US cities and approximately 28,000 census tracts within these cities. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to inform development and implementation of effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these measures include Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (2016, 2015), Census Bureau 2010 census population data, and American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2016, 2011-2015 estimates.

The QRS is a system that rates QHPs based on relative quality and price. Documents describing the QRS data collection guidelines, technical specifications, and the QRS measures are available on this page. CMS is developing two consumer experience surveys to assess consumers and enrollees experiences with the Marketplaces and QHPs. The Health Insurance Marketplace Survey (Marketplace Survey) is intended to obtain consumers perspectives on the services provided by Marketplaces. Conducted during the 2014 open enrollment period, the purpose of the usability testing was to determine whether the State-Based Marketplace Web sites adopted principles for making a Web site usable for consumers and whether information about determining eligibility, comparing and choosing a health plan, and enrollment was easy to find. Results from this assessment are available on this page. The Qualified Health Plan Enrollee Experience Survey (QHP Enrollee Survey) is intended to obtain enrollees perspectives on the services provided by QHPs offered through the Marketplaces.

support the FDA\u0027s post-marketing safety surveillance program for all approved drug and therapeutic biologic products. The FDA uses AERS to monitor for new adverse events and medication errors that might occur with these marketed products. Reporting of adverse events from the point of care is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event and medication error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report these events to the products\u0027 manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations.  The files listed on this page contain raw data extracted from the AERS database for the indicated time ranges and are not cumulative. Users of these files need to be familiar with creation of relational databases using applications such as ORACLE, Microsoft Office Access, MySQL and IBM DB2 or the use of ASCII files with SAS analytic tools.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u0027s (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race\/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"html","accessURL":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2007-nid13522","description":"\u003Cp\u003EDrug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2007)\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2007-nid13522"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2007-nid13522","issued":"2016-05-23","keyword":["alcohol","demographic characteristics","detoxification","drug overdose","drug use","emergency departments","energy drinks","nonprescription drugs","substance abuse","suicide"],"landingPage":"https:\/\/healthdata.gov\/dataset\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2007","modified":"2016-05-23","programCode":["009:030"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Substance Abuse \u0026 Mental Health Services Administration"},"title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2007)"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:30"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"Brooklyn Lupari, SAMHSA\/CBHSQ c\/o SAMHDA Support","hasEmail":"mailto:samhda-support@samhsa.hhs.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) series\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nmeasures the prevalence and correlates of drug use in the United\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nStates.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u0027s (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug-related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 22 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race\/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"html","accessURL":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2011-nid13586","description":"\u003Cp\u003EDrug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2011)\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2011-nid13586"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2011-nid13586","issued":"2016-05-23","keyword":["alcohol","demographic characteristics","detoxification","drug overdose","drug use","emergency departments","energy drinks","nonprescription drugs","substance abuse","suicide"],"landingPage":"https:\/\/healthdata.gov\/dataset\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2011","modified":"2016-05-23","programCode":["009:030"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Substance Abuse \u0026 Mental Health Services Administration"},"title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2011)"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:30"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"Brooklyn Lupari, SAMHSA\/CBHSQ c\/o SAMHDA Support","hasEmail":"mailto:samhda-support@samhsa.hhs.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe Treatment Episode Data Set -- Admissions (TEDS-A) is a national census data system of annual admissions to substance abuse treatment facilities.

Also retained were questions on mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking. Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey.

The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u0027s (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race\/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"html","accessURL":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2004-nid13613","description":"\u003Cp\u003EDrug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2004)\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2004-nid13613"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2004-nid13613","issued":"2016-05-23","keyword":["alcohol","demographic characteristics","detoxification","drug overdose","drug use","emergency departments","energy drinks","nonprescription drugs","substance abuse","suicide"],"landingPage":"https:\/\/healthdata.gov\/dataset\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2004","modified":"2016-05-23","programCode":["009:030"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Substance Abuse \u0026 Mental Health Services Administration"},"title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2004)"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:30"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"Brooklyn Lupari, SAMHSA\/CBHSQ c\/o SAMHDA Support","hasEmail":"mailto:samhda-support@samhsa.hhs.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe Treatment Episode Data Set -- Admissions (TEDS-A) is a national census data system of annual admissions to substance abuse treatment facilities.

First administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), the responsibility for DAWN now rests with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u0027s (SAMHSA) Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality (CBHSQ). Over the years, the exact survey methodology has been adjusted to improve the quality, reliability, and generalizability of the information produced by DAWN. The current approach was first fully implemented in the 2004 data collection year.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nDAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-Federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. DAWN cases are identified by the systematic review of ED medical records in participating hospitals. The unit of analysis is any ED visit involving recent drug use. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. The reason a patient used a drug is not part of the criteria for considering a visit to be drug related. Therefore, all types of drug-related events are included: drug misuse or abuse, accidental drug ingestion, drug-related suicide attempts, malicious drug poisonings, and adverse reactions. DAWN does not report medications that are unrelated to the visit.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe DAWN public-use dataset provides information for all types of drugs, including illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, anesthetic gases, substances that have psychoactive effects when inhaled, alcohol when used in combination with other drugs (all ages), and alcohol alone (only for patients aged 20 or younger). Public-use dataset variables describe and categorize up to 16 drugs contributing to the ED visit, including toxicology confirmation and route of administration. Administrative variables specify the type of case, case disposition, categorized episode time of day, and quarter of year.  Metropolitan area is included for represented metropolitan areas. Created variables include the number of unique drugs reported and case-level indicators for alcohol, non-alcohol illicit substances, any pharmaceutical, non-medical use of pharmaceuticals, and all misuse and abuse of drugs. Demographic items include age category, sex, and race\/ethnicity. Complex sample design and weighting variables are included to calculate various estimates of drug-related ED visits for the Nation as a whole, as well as for specific metropolitan areas, from the ED visits classified as DAWN cases in the selected hospitals.This study has 1 Data Set.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"html","accessURL":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2008-nid13624","description":"\u003Cp\u003EDrug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2008)\u003C\/p\u003E\n","title":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2008-nid13624"}],"identifier":"https:\/\/datafiles.samhsa.gov\/study\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2008-nid13624","issued":"2016-05-23","keyword":["alcohol","demographic characteristics","detoxification","drug overdose","drug use","emergency departments","energy drinks","nonprescription drugs","substance abuse","suicide"],"landingPage":"https:\/\/healthdata.gov\/dataset\/drug-abuse-warning-network-dawn-2008","modified":"2016-05-23","programCode":["009:030"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Substance Abuse \u0026 Mental Health Services Administration"},"title":"Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN-2008)"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:30"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"Brooklyn Lupari, SAMHSA\/CBHSQ c\/o SAMHDA Support","hasEmail":"mailto:samhda-support@samhsa.hhs.gov"},"description":"\u003Cp\u003EThe National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) is designed to collect information from all facilities in the United States, both public and private, that provide substance abuse treatment.

Also retained were questions on\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n    mental health and access to care, perceived risk of using drugs, perceived availability of drugs, driving and personal behavior, and cigar smoking.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n    Questions on the tobacco brand used most often were introduced with the 1999 survey. For the 2008 survey, adult mental health questions were added to\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n    measure symptoms of psychological distress in the worst period of distress that a person experienced in the past 30 days and suicidal ideation. In 2008, a\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n    split-sample design also was included to administer separate sets of questions (WHODAS vs. SDS) to assess impairment due to mental health problems.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\n    Beginning with the 2009 NSDUH, however, all of the adults in the sample received only the WHODAS questions.

The National Health Survey Act of 1956 provided for a continuing survey and special studies to secure accurate and current statistical information on the amount, distribution, and effects of illness and disability in the United States and the services rendered for or because of such conditions. The survey referred to in the Act, now called the National Health Interview Survey, was initiated in July 1957. Since 1960, the survey has been conducted by NCHS, which was formed when the National Health Survey and the National Vital Statistics Division were combined.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nNHIS data are used widely throughout the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to monitor trends in illness and disability and to track progress toward achieving national health objectives. The data are also used by the public health research community for epidemiologic and policy analysis of such timely issues as characterizing those with various health problems, determining barriers to accessing and using appropriate health care, and evaluating Federal health programs.\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nThe NHIS also has a central role in the ongoing integration of household surveys in DHHS. The designs of two major DHHS national household surveys have been or are linked to the NHIS. The National Survey of Family Growth used the NHIS sampling frame in its first five cycles and the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey currently uses half of the NHIS sampling frame. Other linkage includes linking NHIS data to death certificates in the National Death Index (NDI).\u003Cbr \/\u003E\nWhile the NHIS has been conducted continuously since 1957, the content of the survey has been updated about every 10-15 years. In 1996, a substantially revised NHIS questionnaire began field testing. This revised questionnaire, described in detail below, was implemented in 1997 and has improved the ability of the NHIS to provide important health information.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","identifier":"a8f0a8b3-d514-4b7f-9572-17df46727789","issued":"2015-02-03","landingPage":"https:\/\/healthdata.gov\/dataset\/national-health-interview-survey","license":"https:\/\/opendatacommons.org\/licenses\/odbl\/1.0\/","modified":"2020-02-21","programCode":["009:048"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Department of Health \u0026 Human Services"},"title":"National Health Interview Survey","keyword":["centers-for-disease-control-and-prevention-department-of-health-human-services"],"accessLevel":"public"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:38"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"admin","hasEmail":"mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov"},"dataQuality":true,"description":"\u003Cp\u003ELists anemia management data used by ESRD QIP to assess dialysis facility performance.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"csv","accessURL":"https:\/\/data.medicare.gov\/api\/views\/t6ez-29z5\/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD","title":"csv"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"rdf","accessURL":"https:\/\/data.medicare.gov\/api\/views\/t6ez-29z5\/rows.rdf?accessType=DOWNLOAD","title":"rdf"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"json","accessURL":"https:\/\/data.medicare.gov\/api\/views\/t6ez-29z5\/rows.json?accessType=DOWNLOAD","title":"json"},{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"text\/xml","accessURL":"https:\/\/data.medicare.gov\/api\/views\/t6ez-29z5\/rows.xml?accessType=DOWNLOAD","title":"text\/xml"}],"identifier":"bad1d36f-de87-46cc-b327-882bd0fc2650","issued":"2015-01-22","keyword":["dfc","dialysis","dialysis-facilities","linking-quality-to-payment--qip"],"landingPage":"https:\/\/healthdata.gov\/dataset\/esrd-qip-anemia-management-reporting-payment-year-2015","license":"https:\/\/opendatacommons.org\/licenses\/odbl\/1.0\/","modified":"2018-11-30","programCode":["009:078"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"Department of Health \u0026 Human Services"},"theme":["Quality"],"title":"ESRD QIP - Anemia Management Reporting - Payment Year 2015"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:38"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"admin","hasEmail":"mailto:HealthData@hhs.gov"},"dataQuality":true,"description":"\u003Cp\u003EPayment for heart attack patients measure \u2013 provider data.

N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA\u0027s Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service\u0027s datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site.

This core was used throughout the 1970s and 1980s in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration of the National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place, and then occurred annually from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS), which was conducted from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey was conducted and the survey was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available. In 2000, the full survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EN-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a \u0022snapshot\u0022 of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the N-SSATS reference date was October 1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference date to the last business day in March. This change helped increase the timeliness of responses by individual facilities, but resulted in no data being collected for 2001.

TEDS is one of the three components of SAMHSA\u0027s Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), formerly known as the National Master Facility Inventory (NMFI).

Together, they provide national- and state-level information on the numbers and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol and drug treatment and describe the facilities that deliver care to those individuals. TEDS includes facilities that are licensed or certified by the state substance abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for other reasons), and that are required by the states to provide TEDS client-level data. While compromising a significant proportion of all admissions to substance abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions. The scope of admissions included in TEDS is affected by differences in state reporting practices, varying definitions of treatment admission, availability of public funds, and public funding constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible admissions and 67 percent of all known admissions.

Additional variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the state data.

PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (\u0027\u0027\u00c2\u00b5g\/m\u0027\u0027\u00c2\u00b3), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation.

County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program \/ Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center \/ Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data.

In 2002, the survey\u0027s title was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then. This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior to 2002.

Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress\/mood, and responding to slips\/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT \u0022light\u0022 version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to and following the user\u0027s quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user\u0027s quit date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user\u0027s mood, craving level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user\u0027s answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user\u0027s smokefree status and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -\u0027\u0027\u0027\u00a2 Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with quitting smoking in general. -\u0027\u0027\u0027\u00a2 Motivation\/encouragement: Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -\u0027\u0027\u0027\u00a2 Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment. -\u0027\u0027\u0027\u00a2 Assessment: The assessment messages are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the user\u0027s experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback based on the user\u0027s response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood, craving, and smoking status. -\u0027\u0027\u0027\u00a2 Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message relevant to the user\u0027s request for help. In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation.\u003C\/p\u003E\n","distribution":[{"@type":"dcat:Distribution","mediaType":"application\/unknown","format":"html","accessURL":"http:\/\/smokefree.gov\/health-care-professionals","title":"Widget "}],"identifier":"c90f280f-7c5c-4d12-a648-a521301708c0","issued":"2012-05-30","keyword":["cancer","cessation","cigarettes","mobile","mobile health","quitting","smoking","text messaging","tobacco","tobacco control"],"landingPage":"https:\/\/healthdata.gov\/dataset\/quitnowtxt-text-messaging-library","license":"https:\/\/opendatacommons.org\/licenses\/odbl\/1.0\/","modified":"2020-03-04","programCode":["009:047"],"publisher":{"@type":"org:Organization","name":"National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH)"},"theme":["Health"],"title":"QuitNowTXT Text Messaging Library","accessLevel":"public"},{"@type":"dcat:Dataset","accessLevel":"public","bureauCode":["009:33"],"contactPoint":{"fn":"MONAHRQ user support","hasEmail":"mailto:monahrq@ahrq.gov"},"describedBy":"https:\/\/www.ahrq.gov\/professionals\/systems\/monahrq\/software\/index.html","dataQuality":true,"description":"\u003Cp\u003EMONAHRQ\u00ae is a desktop software tool that enables organizations\u2014such as state and local data organizations, regional reporting collaborations, hospitals and hospital systems, nursing homes and nursing home organizations, and health plans\u2014to quickly and easily generate a health care reporting website.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEffective September 27, 2017, technical support and software updates will no longer be available.
